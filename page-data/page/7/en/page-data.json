Our team composition at the time was roughly like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Skill Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Frontend (me)</td>\n<td>All I knew was C and Java from school. Last time I touched JavaScript was in 4th grade.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend</td>\n<td>Had a web design certification. The only one with any web experience on this team. Took the backend role but had never touched a server.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend 2</td>\n<td>Electrical engineering major. Also had zero knowledge of databases or web. Too busy to show up often.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UI/UX Designer</td>\n<td>In the military. Hadn’t even been discharged yet. Would work occasionally while on leave.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Planner</td>\n<td>Korean-Canadian. Music major. Zero IT experience.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Just looking at the team composition, it’s obvious we were a ragtag bunch. Writing this out again, I realize we really were out of our minds. Where did we get that confidence from?</p>\n<p>None of us had ever done web development. Ignorance breeds courage, as they say, and here’s the thing — what this group of people was trying to build was a 3D model editor that runs on the web. And that was just part of the plan; there was even more chaos to come after that. <small>(This project taught me the importance of MVPs during my college years.)</small></p>\n<p>Since I was in charge of frontend, I just dove in headfirst and somehow cobbled things together with JavaScript and jQuery. It was my first time doing anything with graphics, and my first time using <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Three.js</a>, so I struggled quite a bit with the 3D work. But thanks to that, I studied math intensively, and after about three months, I had built a prototype with basic features — loading obj files on the web, changing textures and materials, placing lights to change the atmosphere of the space, and so on.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/6a068/3deditor.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.62500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"3deditor\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/c08c5/3deditor.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/0913d/3deditor.jpg 160w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/cb69c/3deditor.jpg 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/c08c5/3deditor.jpg 640w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/6a068/3deditor.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The nostalgic café next to Hakrim Hall at Dongguk University</small>\n</center>\n<p>At one point, I saw this bald guy more often than my own mother.

I had no idea this was what I was trying to build... What's Euler?

At that point, I think the idea that a good developer is someone who can whip up technically difficult things took root in my mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"after-joining-my-first-company-a-changed-perspective-on-business\" style=\"position:relative;\">After Joining My First Company: A Changed Perspective on Business<a href=\"#after-joining-my-first-company-a-changed-perspective-on-business\" aria-label=\"after joining my first company a changed perspective on business permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Then I graduated in 2016 and, luckily, got a job at a startup about two weeks later. This was when I first properly collaborated with people from other roles — not just developers.</p>\n<p>When bugs occurred in programs I built, customers would contact the CS team, and the CS team would report bugs to the dev team. Or I’d share ideas with designers and planners while building products. In college, it was all just side projects with friends, so I only had simple concerns like “how do I build this?” But at a company, it was completely different. Here, I had to think about additional things:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>What risks or benefits might arise from deploying this feature?</li>\n<li>Should we use an external solution to save development time, or build it ourselves with a long-term view?</li>\n<li>If feature A takes about a month to develop, but we could build two other features in that time, what choice should we make?</li>\n<li>We’ve received a lot of VoC (Voice of Customer) related to this feature — how should we solve it to satisfy users?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>At the time, designers, developers, and planners freely exchanged opinions on these issues. That’s when I realized that ultimately, the most important things for a company are <strong>customers</strong> and <strong>money</strong>.</p>\n<p>This might sound obvious. But arriving at this thought has had a huge influence on my values as a developer. Sure, there are many other important things at a company — employee satisfaction, culture, and so on — but customers and money are the fundamentals. No matter how well I build a program, it’s meaningless if no one uses it. And no matter how great a company’s culture and benefits are, if there’s no money, the company will eventually fail. So this was the first time I thought:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even as a developer, only thinking about technical things might be a narrow perspective.\nUltimately, what I’m building is a product that people use, and I should build it for people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From then on, I thought a lot about how becoming a good developer means thinking deeply about business and users too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"are-emotions-unnecessary-in-professional-work\" style=\"position:relative;\">Are Emotions Unnecessary in Professional Work?<a href=\"#are-emotions-unnecessary-in-professional-work\" aria-label=\"are emotions unnecessary in professional work permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I still continue to work at startups. The reason is that I can take on diverse work that wouldn’t be possible at larger companies, and I enjoy freely sharing opinions and deriving rational conclusions through healthy debate.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all good. Since people gather together, there are various events — feelings get hurt between colleagues, conflicts arise between team members and the company. Especially since the atmosphere is so free, we treat each other almost like friends, and occasionally, <strong>mistakes</strong> happen. <small>(Of course, no matter how flat or free the organization is, everyone maintains basic courtesy.)</small></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 540px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 140%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"everyone\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/0913d/everyone.jpg 160w,\n/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/cb69c/everyone.jpg 320w,\n/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg 540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Some mystery meme someone registered.

I used to strongly agree with sayings like “separate work and personal life” or “responding emotionally, no matter how difficult things are, is unprofessional.” I still think nothing good comes from emotions getting mixed into professional work. But lately, I’ve also been thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter how much you try to exclude emotions, isn’t that impossible since we’re all human?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether someone is smart, senior, or junior — they’re all human, so of course there are difficult times and happy times, right? I’ve seen a senior developer dismiss such things as whining and call it unprofessional. Sure, if someone is going around broadcasting their emotions everywhere, that person has issues. But forcing someone to completely suppress emotions that inevitably leak out seems strange too.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/2f3ecdd358609e79d87e38139b88663c/ddced/brain.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 80%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"brain\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/2f3ecdd358609e79d87e38139b88663c/c08c5/brain.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/2f3ecdd358609e79d87e38139b88663c/0913d/brain.jpg 160w,\n/static/2f3ecdd358609e79d87e38139b88663c/cb69c/brain.jpg 320w,\n/static/2f3ecdd358609e79d87e38139b88663c/c08c5/brain.jpg 640w,\n/static/2f3ecdd358609e79d87e38139b88663c/6a068/brain.jpg 960w,\n/static/2f3ecdd358609e79d87e38139b88663c/ddced/brain.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Emotions are said to occur through hormone secretion triggered by brain signals. This isn't something you can control by willpower.</small>\n</center>\n<p>Personally, I don’t think of the POs, designers, and developers I work directly with as just coworkers. It’s more like “somewhere between coworkers and friends.” It might sound like splitting hairs, but anyway, I don’t think of them as purely professional relationships. We’re all people running hard together toward the same goal, around the same age, and our values aren’t that different either.</p>\n<p>So if a team member is going through emotional difficulties because of something bad that happened, and it’s showing, I think “Isn’t there something I can help with?” rather than criticizing them for bringing emotions to work.</p>\n<p>Helping isn’t even difficult. It’s just casually saying “Whoa, you don’t look so great today. Want to grab a coffee?” then going to a café, listening to them talk, and hanging out for 20-30 minutes. Just doing that much might help the troubled team member organize their thoughts, sort out their emotions by talking to someone, and focus better on work again, right?</p>\n<p>Humans are emotional beings. I don’t think you can understand anything while excluding emotions. Overlooking this means there can be no <strong>healthy communication</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusions-so-far\" style=\"position:relative;\">Conclusions So Far<a href=\"#conclusions-so-far\" aria-label=\"conclusions so far permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Ultimately, my current thinking leans heavily toward: “Even as a developer, you can’t become a good developer by only pursuing technical things” — if I want to be remembered as “that person was a good person; it was great working together” even after leaving a job.</p>\n<p>After all, aren’t developers also workers who must collaborate and communicate with someone? Even freelancers must communicate with clients. A developer who’s simply good at coding won’t be remembered by others as “a developer who’s great to work with.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The person you want to work with isn’t necessarily someone who’s just good at their job.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An attitude that fully respects someone’s opinion during meetings, even if they disagree with me, even if they have less experience, even if they’re an elementary school student.</p>\n<p>An attitude that, when someone is emotionally struggling, helps them recover their pace by listening to their concerns rather than criticizing them for being unprofessional.</p>\n<p>Or an attitude that can at least acknowledge that someone felt a certain emotion, even if you don’t understand it.</p>\n<p>Having these basic attitudes is what allows you to become not just a good developer, but a good colleague, right? Of course, I’m shy by nature, so I’m not exactly a warm person. <small>(I’ve been told since childhood that I give bad first impressions.)</small> But regardless of individual personality, I believe we should at least have respect and consideration for the people we collaborate with. Personally, I think anyone can improve their technical hard skills if they work hard — the speed might differ, but everyone improves. And I believe developers are already putting effort into their technical specs without anyone having to tell them.</p>\n<p>But soft skills like communication and consideration for others are easy to neglect unconsciously unless you pay attention regularly, so I think it’s important to keep reflecting, stay mindful, and maintain an attitude of seeking continuous feedback. Recently, I received feedback from someone on another team that my tone is too stiff and intimidating, which was a bit discouraging. But since then, I’ve been trying to be more mindful of how I speak. I’m not sure if it’s working though… haha</p>\n<p>So these are my thoughts and conclusions so far, after four years of working as a developer and pondering <strong>what makes a good developer</strong>. I still have many more years of work and life ahead, so my current conclusions might change again. But I think “an attitude of consideration for others” remains important whether I’m a developer or doing something else entirely.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190606-what-is-good-programmer-en","path":"/2019/06/06/what-is-good-programmer/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Makes a Good Developer?","subTitle":"Beyond coding skills — reflections on becoming someone others want to work with","date":"Jun 06, 2019","categories":["Essay","Soft Skills"],"tags":["Good Programmer","Developer","Programmer","Soft Skills"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/3a812/3deditor.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/3a812/3deditor.jpg 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/4b287/3deditor.jpg 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/fc5c5/3deditor.webp 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/e9225/3deditor.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/2d839/3deditor.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/2d839/3deditor.jpg 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/b384d/3deditor.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"58686e18-f7e5-5dea-81ab-ce1ca9644dd5","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#why-did-i-start-optimization\">Why Did I Start Optimization?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#identifying-problems\">Identifying Problems</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#not-using-text-compression\">Not Using Text Compression</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#offscreen-images-need-deferral\">Offscreen Images Need Deferral</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#network-payload-size-too-large\">Network Payload Size Too Large</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#minimize-main-thread-work\">Minimize Main Thread Work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ensure-text-remains-visible-during-webfont-load\">Ensure Text Remains Visible During Webfont Load</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#actions\">Actions</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#image-lazy-loading\">Image Lazy Loading</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#component-lazy-loading\">Component Lazy Loading</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#apply-gzip-compression-for-text-content\">Apply gzip Compression for Text Content</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#js\">JS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#css\">CSS</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#results\">Results</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"In this post I want to write about the client-side rendering optimization I worked on at my current workplace.

But one thing I worried about was “If I do lazy loading, won’t Google’s Search Engine Bot fail to scrape images?”</p>\n<p>So I did a bit of research to see how other people think about this. There were several methods like using <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;noscript></code> tags, making image sitemaps using XML, and some said Google’s Search Engine Bot indexes all images loaded using lazy loading anyway, so you don’t need to worry.</p>\n<p>So I discussed this problem with the PO (Product Owner). As a result, since images on the Find a Pro page are only user profile images anyway, and these images were judged to have no major SEO impact whether indexed or not, we decided to just apply lazy loading without separate measures.</p>\n<p>Since Soomgo frontend uses Vue, I implemented image lazy loading functionality using Vue’s <code class=\"language-text\">Directive</code> and HTML5’s <code class=\"language-text\">IntersectionObserver</code> API. First, inside the component rendering user profile images, since it’s rendering user profiles using CSS’s <code class=\"language-text\">background-image</code> property rather than <code class=\"language-text\">img</code> tags, the interface of this directive I envisioned was roughly like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-html line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>test<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">v-lazy-background-image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- After directive binding --></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span>\n  <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>test<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token attr-name\">v-lazy-background-image</span>\n  <span class=\"token attr-name\">data-lazy-background-image</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Let's remove image URL from styles and store image URL here<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-css line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.test</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">background-image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token url\"><span class=\"token function\">url</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>https://assets.soomgo.com/user/example.jpeg<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">/* After directive binding */</span>\n<span class=\"token selector\">.test</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>When there’s an element like this, the <code class=\"language-text\">lazy-background-image</code> directive accesses the bound element’s <code class=\"language-text\">style</code> property, and if there’s a <code class=\"language-text\">background-image</code> property, it seemed like it could store that URL in a separate property then lazy load that image when the element enters the viewport.</p>\n<p>If envisioned up to here, just implement the Observer simply.

Due to how this plugin processes CSS modules loaded with Dynamic import, a <code class=\"language-text\">ReferenceError: document is not defined</code> reference error occurred in the SSR cycle.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> linkTag <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"link\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ReferenceError: document is not defined</span>\nlinkTag<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>rel <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"stylesheet\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nlinkTag<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>type <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"text/css\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nlinkTag<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>onload <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> resolve<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nlinkTag<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>href <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> fullhref<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nhead<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">appendChild</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>linkTag<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The original code is huge, but simply distilling it, here’s where the problem occurred. Since the SSR cycle executes in a NodeJS process, naturally there’s no document or anything, so a reference error occurred.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, build configuration is managed separately as <code class=\"language-text\">client.config</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">server.config</code>, so I could take appropriate measures. Since the client-side rendering cycle has no problems, I just needed to fix it only when Express compiles Vue on the initial request.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, developers from around the world who had done the same grunt work as me on StackOverflow had already reached some conclusions through heated discussions about <a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/issues/90\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mini-css-extract-plugin’s SSR-related issue</a>. We are the world.</p>\n<p>Various methods were discussed, but I chose the method of using <code class=\"language-text\">css-loader</code>’s <code class=\"language-text\">exportOnlyLocals</code> option. The issue says to use <code class=\"language-text\">css-loader/locals</code>, but since css-loader was updated after this issue was discussed, you now need to use an options object.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\">module<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>exports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">merge</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>baseConfig<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// ...</span>\n  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">module</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">rules</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token literal-property property\">test</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token regex\"><span class=\"token regex-delimiter\">/</span><span class=\"token regex-source language-regex\">\\.scss$</span><span class=\"token regex-delimiter\">/</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token literal-property property\">use</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n          <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token literal-property property\">loader</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'css-loader'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token literal-property property\">options</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">exportOnlyLocals</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n          <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          <span class=\"token string\">'postcss-loader'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          <span class=\"token string\">'sass-loader'</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// ...</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>I solved the problem like this, but first since this technology’s stability was judged not sufficiently confirmed within the frontend chapter, I’m currently only lazy loading components related to the original target Find a Pro page.

As a result, I could confirm loading speed of non-member accessible pages became about 1 second faster.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Before</th>\n<th>After</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2513.9ms</td>\n<td>1111.5ms</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"results\" style=\"position:relative;\">Results<a href=\"#results\" aria-label=\"results permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Working hard on this and that, it did get a bit faster.</p>\n<p>Before\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;

Let’s do structural design.</li>\n<li>The number of layers and nodes per layer should be freely changeable.</li>\n<li>It would be nice to visualize the process of loss decreasing and changes in weights!</li>\n<li>Let’s enable changing application inputs and initial weight values directly within the application!</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Among these, I couldn’t do #4 due to time shortage since I had to make seminar PPT too, but I somehow succeeded in implementing #1-3 within time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"loss-varies-depending-on-neuron-connections\" style=\"position:relative;\">Loss Varies Depending on Neuron Connections<a href=\"#loss-varies-depending-on-neuron-connections\" aria-label=\"loss varies depending on neuron connections permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>First, I had to think about how to implement the feature of updating weights, which is ANN’s core function.

What changes is only #1, the contribution of the neuron’s output affecting error. More precisely, only the method of calculating contribution changes depending on situation.

However, when evaluating sorting algorithms, we typically focus on time complexity, so that’s what we’ll examine here.</p>\n<p>To better understand time complexity, let’s look at the time complexity of the binary search algorithm. If you’re not familiar with binary search, think of the “Higher or Lower” number guessing game. As most people know, it’s a game where you have to guess a random number someone else is thinking of.</p>\n<p>What’s the best way to minimize the number of guesses? The answer is to start with the middle value: <code class=\"language-text\">50</code>. After calling <code class=\"language-text\">50</code>, when your opponent says “higher” or “lower,” you can discard the 50 numbers on the wrong side and only think about the remaining 50.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 306px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/01fdd/drink.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB682wjYVYFQf/xAAaEAEBAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABECEiIh/9oACAEBAAEFAnym3qQjn80k2y7N/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAwEBPwEf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAgEBPwEf/8QAGhAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAAIaERIv/aAAgBAQAGPwLp12Z52Wiv/8QAGxAAAwADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIWFxMVH/2gAIAQEAAT8hb4GwrV55TQ9ijKS2PTAlWoJi5rox5H//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEDjAPP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQMBAT8QH//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEg/9oACAECAQE/EGP/xAAdEAEAAgIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFRYXHh/9oACAEBAAE/EETQATCbyGc6lLFGkFwxxkjRRlDzHGky2FV8Y6cW+9u3n5HwiXpeDmpRTsF81CWljV2emYUaj//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"drink\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/01fdd/drink.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/0913d/drink.jpg 160w,\n/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/01fdd/drink.jpg 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>If you're lucky and your opponent was thinking of 50, the game ends immediately and they have to drink.</small>\n</center>\n<p>Anyway, the worst case in this game is going back and forth with “higher” and “lower” until it ends in <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mi>N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O({\\log}N)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mop\">lo<span style=\"margin-right:0.01389em;\">g</span></span></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">N</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span></span> guesses.

The key is whether you can effectively solve the problem by using the right algorithm for the situation.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine you have a bag containing balls numbered 1 through 10 in random order, and you need to take them out one by one and arrange them from smallest to largest. Most humans can sort these without much difficulty. But computers often deal with <code class=\"language-text\">10,000</code> or even <code class=\"language-text\">10,000,000</code> pieces of data. And databases theoretically need to handle infinite amounts of data.</p>\n<p>If the data isn’t sorted, you’d have to look at each piece of data sequentially while searching. But if the data is already sorted, you can use powerful algorithms like the binary search I mentioned above. <small>(This is actually the biggest reason.)</small></p>\n<p>Now let’s look at the representative sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bubble-sort\" style=\"position:relative;\">Bubble Sort<a href=\"#bubble-sort\" aria-label=\"bubble sort permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<img src=\"/1692a508cdbd24d8651e01ffe00385dd/bubble_sort.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n<p>Bubble sort shows the worst performance in almost every situation, but it shows the best performance on already-sorted data since it only needs to traverse once. You might wonder why you’d sort already-sorted data, but it’s meaningful because the sorting algorithm itself operates without knowing whether the data is sorted or not.</p>\n<p>Bubble sort works in the following order:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Compare and sort the 0th and 1st elements</li>\n<li>Compare and sort the 1st and 2nd elements</li>\n<li>…keep repeating</li>\n<li>Compare and sort the (n-1)th and nth elements</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Each traversal sorts one element at the end, so it looks like bubbles rising — hence the name bubble sort. The principle is intuitive and easy to implement, but it’s a fairly inefficient sorting method.

problem into several smaller problems, solves each one, and then combines the results to solve the original problem. As the name “merge” suggests, it’s an algorithm that sorts during the process of splitting the given data into small pieces and then merging them back together.

At first I regretted “should’ve just used Nuxt…” but thanks to that I think it was a good opportunity to learn more deeply about Universal SSR’s execution process. <small><del>(wrapping grunt work like this)</del></small></p>\n<p>In this post I want to describe in detail down to the function level about the initialization process of the SSR application I wrote. First, the application’s rendering process is as follows. I’ll describe each process in detail afterward.</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Client requests resources from server</li>\n<li>nginx serves requests to port where Express is running</li>\n<li>Express routing starts</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">server-entry.js</code> executes</li>\n<li>Server’s <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> routing proceeds</li>\n<li>Render HTML using vue-server-renderer</li>\n<li>Server responds to client</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">client-entry.js</code> executes</li>\n<li>Client application initialization function executes</li>\n<li>Client’s <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> routing proceeds</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">app.$mount</code></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Excluding request #1 and response #7, steps <code class=\"language-text\">2-6</code> are processes happening on the server and steps <code class=\"language-text\">8-10</code> are processes happening on the client. What’s peculiar is that server and client have different entry points.</p>\n<p>And as I’ll explain later, these entry points share and use several same functions. Functions like <code class=\"language-text\">router.onReady</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">createApp</code> are like that. Originally Universal SSR is basically the concept of “let’s server-side render just the first request and afterward operate like an SPA. And let’s make code reusable on server and client.” So there are convenient aspects, but since execution timing or environment can be completely different even for the same function, there were many confusing parts like needing to do separate exception handling.</p>\n<p>And when these two entry points execute on server and client, they go through different initialization processes. If you initialize on the server then initialize everything from scratch again on the client, it’s inefficient, so it uses several methods to perform rendering as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Let’s first look at server-side rendering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-side-rendering\" style=\"position:relative;\">Server Side Rendering<a href=\"#server-side-rendering\" aria-label=\"server side rendering permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"client-requests-resources-from-server\" style=\"position:relative;\">Client Requests Resources from Server<a href=\"#client-requests-resources-from-server\" aria-label=\"client requests resources from server permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The client sends a request to the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nginx-serves-requests-to-port-where-express-is-running\" style=\"position:relative;\">nginx Serves Requests to Port Where Express Is Running<a href=\"#nginx-serves-requests-to-port-where-express-is-running\" aria-label=\"nginx serves requests to port where express is running permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Usually when developing servers using nodeJS, directly launching servers with commands like <code class=\"language-text\">node server.js</code> is rare. Usually you use server engines like Nginx or Apache together.\nThe reasons are as follows:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Due to server engine software characteristics, faster static file serving than nodeJS is possible.

I used Express, I naturally used Express’s router. But since Vue proceeds with actual routing, in Express you use wildcards like <code class=\"language-text\">app.get('*')</code> to execute callback functions for all requests.</p>\n<p>Looking in the middle, there’s also code like <code class=\"language-text\">app.get('/ping')</code> - that’s a router written separately because of AWS Elastic Beanstalk’s Health Check. ELB periodically pings specific URLs of instances belonging to that environment to check if the current environment is operating properly. This URL can be changed in ELB settings, and I set it as the URL <code class=\"language-text\">/ping</code>.</p>\n<p>The reason for separating this router separately is because the more <code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code>’s render function executes, the more HTML templates go up in memory, and thereby bottlenecks occur in the render process, so I set it to send a simple page as a response with just Express without executing <code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code>.</p>\n<p>Express routing and <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> routing I’ll explain below can be confusing. As I just explained, actual routing proceeds in Vue, but Express receives and processes requests first then passes them to Vue, so routing must be done in Express too. After routing, when the <code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code> method on the last line executes, routing and rendering proceeding in Vue start.</p>\n<p>Now I’ll explain the inside of the <code class=\"language-text\">app.get('*')</code> router in detail.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js

most important part in this routing is the role of the <code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code> method.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code> has 2 render functions: <code class=\"language-text\">renderToString</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code>.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">renderToString</code> returns rendered HTML in string form when all rendering finishes, then afterward returns HTML to the client at once. Therefore, if render speed takes long, users have no choice but to look at a blank screen. Also, since it sends data at once, it has the disadvantage of having to put all content in memory when proceeding with HTML rendering. If HTML size is small it’s not a problem, but the larger the file size, the more memory space each rendering eats up.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code> returns a nodeJS <code class=\"language-text\">ReadableStream</code> object whenever one event finishes. <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stream</a> is a nodeJS feature that can load data in certain chunk units and manage streams with event callback calls using the <code class=\"language-text\">on</code> method. The data event is called whenever each chunk becomes <code class=\"language-text\">readable</code> state, and if all data is loaded, the <code class=\"language-text\">end</code> event is called.

But there’s one problem using this logic as is on the server.</p>\n<p>The problem occurs when returning data types using Call by Reference evaluation strategy with <code class=\"language-text\">export default</code>. Since <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> called in <code class=\"language-text\">new Vue()</code> operates like a class returning instances, this code ultimately returns the memory address where the <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instance went up. This logic has no particular problems on clients, but problems can occur on servers.</p>\n<p>Unlike clients, servers are programs that, once up, keep running for a long time. Since users currently accessing the server shouldn’t share <code class=\"language-text\">Store</code> state, servers must create new <code class=\"language-text\">Store</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instances for each request.</p>\n<p>But what’s <code class=\"language-text\">export</code>ed in the above code is ultimately the <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instance’s memory pointer, and when this module is <code class=\"language-text\">import</code>ed, this module creates a <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instance just once at first, then afterward returns the memory pointer to reference - that is, <strong>the same instance</strong>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, during server-side rendering, to avoid state pollution, you must write it by exposing factory functions instead of instance memory pointers and creating and returning new instances every time.</p>\n<p>I missed this fact and created a bug where users shared sessions inside <code class=\"language-text\">Store</code>, so logging in with my account logged in as someone else’s account. It’s a dizzying moment even thinking about it now.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Node.js server is a long-running process. When our code is required into the process, it will be evaluated once and stays in memory.\n…\nSo, instead of directly creating an app instance, we should expose a factory function that can be repeatedly executed to create fresh app instances for each request.</p>\n<p><strong>Vue SSR Guide</strong> <em>Avoid Stateful Singletons</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even written blatantly like this in the <a href=\"https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/structure.html#avoid-stateful-singletons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">official documentation</a>, I missed it and created a huge bug. We must read official documentation! Read it twice, three times!</p>\n<p>Okay, now that we’ve looked at <code class=\"language-text\">createApp</code>, let’s return to <code class=\"language-text\">server-entry.js</code> and continue

Why must we necessarily store authenticated tokens in Store? First, since this server is a render server that only performs rendering, session validity checks must communicate with external API servers to perform.</p>\n<p>Authentication state may be needed on the server and may also be needed on the client. Then you must communicate once on the server to check tokens and also communicate on the client to check tokens. But since this method is inefficient, frameworks supporting universal SSR like this usually use the method of serializing server state into the <code class=\"language-text\">window</code> object and declaring it inside <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;script></code> tags during rendering to return server state to clients.</p>\n<p>In <code class=\"language-text\">vue-server-renderer</code>, server state to return to clients is declared using <a href=\"https://vuex.vuejs.org/kr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vuex</a>, Vue’s <a href=\"https://haruair.github.io/flux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flux architecture</a> library.</p>\n<p>Thus server state gets serialized using <code class=\"language-text\">JSON.stringify</code> during rendering and contained in the property <code class=\"language-text\">window.__INITIAL_STATE__</code>, and afterward during client initialization, it accesses that property, uses <code class=\"language-text\">JSON.parse</code> to convert to Object type, then uses Vuex Store’s <code class=\"language-text\">replaceState</code> method to update Store.</p>\n<center>\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/37523/initial_state.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 38.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAABIElEQVR42p2Sy26DMBBF8yVdYBuS8jABTACpQFQUIAQ23fT/f+TUYVFVeVRVF0cjeaTjO2NvYt8n0xH5fk8ShRyShLei4Nx11EVOFgmWk6ZvAppiZ6vPqfaJdhJPOGxv2Ggds7cSk+drzYwhzQxllfM+fpLmbzjOC1IJPE/hWjzPxXUlQt6zcd1r8wfKxdt6lGnBWH5QmoamrWmbllc7jeMIpJBI+ZiNEIJbpJKYKKeLOruOlMs8sywLQRBYofNUtgrvDu3tylVWaBiTiT4ZKdKSYRwYhgGt9a/Sp8I0yjjFPY1uOR6PTNNEVVUopf6XMNeHVWhiw/lyZr7MhGH4nW5dzZ+E8iqUpGFGHbVkvqFuaoZ+wNgfsPZtyusDPkr7BYT48n0a47z1AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"initial state\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/6af66/initial_state.png\" srcset=\"/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/69538/initial_state.png 160w,\n/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/72799/initial_state.png 320w,\n/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/6af66/initial_state.png 640w,\n/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/37523/initial_state.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <small>You can check it like this in browser console</small>\n</center>\n<h3 id=\"servers-code-classlanguage-textvue-routercode-routing-proceeds\" style=\"position:relative;\">Server’s <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> Routing Proceeds<a href=\"#servers-code-classlanguage-textvue-routercode-routing-proceeds\" aria-label=\"servers code classlanguage textvue routercode routing proceeds permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Let’s look at routing logic that was #2. Universal SSR applications proceed with routing on the server side the very first time users open pages, and afterward when users move pages, routing proceeds on the client.</p>\n<p>In other words, routing logic inside <code class=\"language-text\">server-entry.js</code> is logic that executes exactly once when users initially execute the application for the very first time. Since I wrote router authentication-related logic on the client, only checking whether components are connected to this router on the server, I wrote server-side entry routing logic simply.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">router</code> object used in this file is an instance of the <code class=\"language-text\">VueRouter</code> class in the <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> library created and returned by the <code class=\"language-text\">createApp</code> factory function. I decided to just check whether the current route is a valid route using this class’s <code class=\"language-text\">getMatchedComponents</code> method.</p>\n<p>The meaning of <code class=\"language-text\">VueRouter</code>’s member variables and methods is also in <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code>’s <a href=\"https://router.vuejs.org/kr/api/#router-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">official documentation</a>, but sometimes libraries are updated but official documentation updates are late, so I directly looked at <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code>’s code.</p>\n<p>Looking at the <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules/vue-router/types/router.d.ts</code> file, you can confirm the <code class=\"language-text\">VueRouter</code> class’s member variables and methods.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\"

it’s current workplace code, I couldn’t write everything, but the logic the <code class=\"language-text\">init</code> function performs is reflecting server store state to client and user authentication processing. Since the principle of receiving server store state was explained in <a href=\"/2018/09/25/vue-ssr/#code-classlanguage-textserver-entryjscode-execution\">server-entry.js execution</a>, this time I’ll try explaining “why process login on client instead of server.”</p>\n<p>The reason is because this server is a render server without separate authentication logic, so tasks like getting user information or checking authentication depend entirely on external API servers. Initially I overlooked this fact and chose the method of communicating with APIs during server rendering then sending user data down to clients, but the following problems occurred:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>API communication time was included in HTML template render time. <small>(Since server rendering’s lifecycle also ends when rendering finishes, you have no choice but to synchronously process API communication using the <code class=\"language-text\">await</code> keyword during rendering. Even the authenticated user information GET API is quite slow)</small></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code>’s <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> method’s execution time increased.</li>\n<li>As <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> method’s execution time increased, more templates went up in memory at once.</li>\n<li>Memory fills up and can no longer perform rendering.</li>\n<li>Server cannot respond.</li>\n<li>Fail</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>So the part I focused on most when building this render server was shortening the <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> method’s execution time, and as a result, logic fetching user data went down to the client. Thinking about it later, views needing currently authenticated user data are parts not needing SEO, so there was no need to do it on the server. Now let’s finally look at client routing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clients-code-classlanguage-textvue-routercode-routing-proceeds\" style=\"position:relative;\">Client’s <code

Client rendering only newly renders parts where components changed when the router changes and keeps the rest as is, so the next router may be using components that were in the current router as is.</p>\n<p>The important point is that on the client too, <code class=\"language-text\">asyncData</code> is being used to <code class=\"language-text\">fetch</code> data before routing completes, just like on the server.</p>\n<p>In other words, if a component existing in the current router also exists in the next router, there’s no need to perform duplicate logic in that component’s <code class=\"language-text\">asyncData</code>, so logic must be written to perform logic comparing components when the router changes, then only perform <code class=\"language-text\">asyncData</code> of changed components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"appmount---rendering-ends-vue-lifecycle-starts\" style=\"position:relative;\">app.$mount -> Rendering Ends.

Both SSR and SPA methods have pros and cons of loading speed. What’s different?</p>\n<p>SSR’s advantage is initial loading speed. SPA downloads all static resources used in the entire application during first loading, so initial loading speed is slow, but afterward there’s no need to additionally download resources, so operating speed afterward is fast.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, SSR only needs to load resources needed on current pages, so initial loading speed can be faster compared to SPA. However, since received static resources aren’t stored somewhere, even resources received on previous pages must be received from scratch again whenever pages move.</p>\n<p>So loading time during page moves after application initialization can be slower in SSR.</p>\n<p>But SPA method’s tremendous disadvantage is exactly SEO. SEO is abbreviation for Search Engine Optimization, meaning search engine optimization as directly translated.</p>\n<p>Search engines are basically based on crawling and collecting pages. The problem is that bots doing crawling don’t have ability to execute JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Recently cases like Google crawler are said to have JavaScript execution ability, but personally I see it as not yet trustworthy to that degree. Moreover, when sharing pages on SNS like Facebook, crawlers must read Open Graph tags for shared site information to display correctly. When crawlers read pages where JavaScript didn’t execute, there’s just blank pages, so there were problems of not properly displaying information.</p>\n<p>I also tried methods like <code class=\"language-text\">#!</code> (hashbang), <code class=\"language-text\">_esacped_fragment_</code>, or <code class=\"language-text\">Pre rendering</code> to solve this problem, but even writing applications as recommended by search engine companies, compared to SSR methods, they couldn’t help not properly scraping data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emergence-of-new-concept-server-side-rendering\" style=\"position:relative;\">Emergence of New Concept Server Side Rendering<a href=\"#emergence-of-new-concept-server-side-rendering\" aria-label=\"emergence of new concept server side rendering permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Choose SSR and SPA’s advantages are wasteful.

Directly translating to Korean means 역전파 (reverse propagation).

First, composite functions are just functions where other functions are given as arguments to some function. Writing it in code, you can quickly know what feeling it is.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">f</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">g</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> g <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">g</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">x</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token constant\">F</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">f</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">g</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// F = 12</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Then what does it mean to be differentiable? If you understand differentiation as something like finding slopes between <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">x'</code>, you might think “why find slopes in composite functions or whatever?”</p>\n<p>But saying find slopes is the same as finding change amounts. Looking at the above code, you can see that when declaring variable <code class=\"language-text\">F</code>, if you change values given to <code class=\"language-text\">g</code>, the final <code class=\"language-text\">F</code> value changes.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token constant\">F</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">f</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">g</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// F = 15</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">F</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">f</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">g</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// F = 9</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>In other words, Chain Rule, simply speaking, means you can know how much function <code class=\"language-text\">g</code> changes when <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> changes, and how much function <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> changes due to function <code class=\"language-text\">g</code>’s change, and if you can know such chain changes, ultimately you can know the contribution of each function <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">g</code> contributing to final value <code class=\"language-text\">F</code>’s change amount.</p>\n<p>Just now in the composite function <code class=\"language-text\">F</code> used as an example above, the variable entering the expression was just one <code class=\"language-text\">x</code>.

It seemed very simple, but since <code class=\"language-text\">XOR</code> is not a linear equation, only 50% accuracy could be achieved with straight lines. People who reached this point became frustrated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need to use MLP, Multi Layer Perceptrons.\nNo one on earth had found a viable way to train MLPs good enough to learn such simple functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Perceptrons(1969)</strong> <em>Marvin Minsky</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eventually in 1969, <strong>Marvin Minsky</strong> mathematically proved that the <code class=\"language-text\">XOR</code> problem cannot be solved with a Single Layer Network. He said it’s possible with a Multi Layer Network but nobody can train it.</p>\n<p>I wanted to know more about this reason, so I looked up passages from Perceptrons and found:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it ought to be possible to devise a training alhorithm to optimize the weights in thie using, say, the magnitude of a reinforcement signal to communicate to the net the cost of an error. We have not investigated this.</p>\n<p><strong>Perceptrons(1969)</strong> <em>Marvin Minsky</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Googling around, I found opinions that the book Perceptrons focused on explaining why <code class=\"language-text\">XOR</code> doesn’t train with a Single Layer Network and then wrote something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well… we know training with a Multi Layer Network should work, but we don’t quite know how to do it yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, this book disappointed many people, and because of this, the entire field of Neural Networks entered a dark age.</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-to-rise-again\" style=\"position:relative;\">Time to Rise Again<a href=\"#time-to-rise-again\" aria-label=\"time to rise again permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>In 1974, Paul Werbos published an algorithm called “Backpropagation” in his doctoral dissertation.</p>\n<p>But sadly, nobody paid attention, and even Marvin Minsky, the author of Perceptrons, didn’t show interest. He even republished the paper in 1982, but it was just buried again…</p>\n<p>Then in 1986, Geoffrey Hinton independently rediscovered this algorithm and presented it, gaining attention. Anyway, because of this algorithm, the fact that training Multi Layer Networks is possible became known, and the field of Neural Networks became vibrant again.</p>\n<p>The structure of the Backpropagation algorithm is simple. It’s literally propagating errors back (Back) from the side closest to the output (Propagation).

The payment flow is divided into 3 main stages.</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Authentication process to receive access token from PayPal server using <code class=\"language-text\">client_key</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">secret</code></li>\n<li>Process to <code class=\"language-text\">create</code> payment</li>\n<li>Process to <code class=\"language-text\">execute</code> payment</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>First, the client must render a button and send a <code class=\"language-text\">create</code> request through this service’s API. At this time, the difference from the previous flow is that there’s no particular need to use <code class=\"language-text\">checkout.js</code>. First, render the button. For reference, I used <code class=\"language-text\">AngularJS</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">md-material</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-html line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">layout</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>row<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">layout-align</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>center center<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">layout</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>column<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>md-button</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">md-color</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>{background: 'blue-grey'}<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">ng-click</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>vm.postData()<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n      TEST\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>md-button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>After that, since duplicate logic will need to be written when PayPal payment is used on other pages, I defined a separate factory.

when clicking the test button on the client, payment data is transmitted to my API server through the API I predefined called <code class=\"language-text\">/paypal/payment/create</code>, and the API server communicates with PayPal servers again with that data and returns results to the client. Then the client just opens the redirect page contained in <code class=\"language-text\">link[1]</code> of the returned data and payment starts!</p>\n<p>I’ll explain why it’s <code class=\"language-text\">link[1]</code> again below.</p>\n<p>After this, users move to either the login page or payment confirmation page depending on PayPal login status, and when clicking the Continue button in PayPal’s payment confirmation window, they land on the <code class=\"language-text\">redirect_url</code> page we sent through the <code class=\"language-text\">create</code> API earlier.</p>\n<p>At this time, PayPal sends data that the user has completed final payment confirmation and payment can now start, attached as a query string after the <code class=\"language-text\">redirect_url</code>.</p>\n<p>Now all basic client and server logic is ready! Explaining the overall flow again, it’s as follows:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Client sends payment creation request to API server.</li>\n<li>API server sends payment creation request to PayPal server again with received data, then returns values to client.</li>\n<li>Client redirects user to <code class=\"language-text\">redirect_url</code> in returned data.</li>\n<li>Then user completes login and brief payment information confirmation on the moved PayPal page and clicks the <code class=\"language-text\">Continue</code> button.</li>\n<li>When <code class=\"language-text\">Continue</code> button is clicked, PayPal redirects user to the <code class=\"language-text\">redirect_url</code> contained in the payment creation request.</li>\n<li>Then user confirms detailed payment information before final payment on the redirected page.</li>\n<li>When user clicks the “final payment” button, client sends payment execution request to API server.</li>\n<li>API server passes this request to PayPal server again and returns values to client.</li>\n<li>User is redirected again to the corresponding page according to payment execution result.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>It looks very complicated, but looking closely, the API server is basically just a communication shuttle.</p>\n<p>Then you might think “Can’t we just communicate directly with PayPal servers?” but this is a problem directly connected to security. To communicate with PayPal servers, you need <code class=\"language-text\">client_key</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">secret</code>, and communicating directly with PayPal servers without mediating through the API server means the client must have both these values.</p>\n<p>But as you know, client source on the web is easily exposed, and even with obfuscation, <code class=\"language-text\">String</code> variables like Object <code class=\"language-text\">keys</code> are not obfuscated, so malicious users can easily steal <code class=\"language-text\">client_key</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">secret</code>. So you store <code class=\"language-text\">secret</code> on the relatively safe server and store only <code class=\"language-text\">client_key</code> on the client, splitting the two values so they can’t be seen at once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"execution-results\" style=\"position:relative;\">Execution Results<a href=\"#execution-results\" aria-label=\"execution results permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>First, as a result of proceeding with the create request through the API server, I was able to receive the following response.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ee391623f4d89ab9517f34c1a64c178c/5bb8b/result1.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 28.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABGUlEQVR42lWQ6U7DMBCE8zKotEmatInvM0ebFIQqJBAS7/8ew9oRVPz4tJ61tZ7ZgtsF7Unj3Dt0zIEJn+mYRc8fOpG0NBGKECpAyIDmZFDWCnWjUVYShVg+8HJfEccAJi2U9YQDV3Q2Dpq0tluVpOMU4YcI6wNsCCiPEk87ht2eY3/gKHh4zQ/OTNMvEsd2o/6tzaNWjUB1FKSJ09Zn0tBHlhIY7EuBQq2f2eHX94rxMoCTS6lddsuVyzq5TQjqC+op43OSnm994zy9SwPJobq8Y327YrlNdBFgfMxI7bN2YaB4cashYl5mzNeZoo+0ppF6yYTH80EQKfJ0zwPjtO2jPSu0nf6LnknxKHKZ4/5fSSKtIQ1LA38AHnLHaTWOUI4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"result1\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ee391623f4d89ab9517f34c1a64c178c/6af66/result1.png\" srcset=\"/static/ee391623f4d89ab9517f34c1a64c178c/69538/result1.png 160w,\n/static/ee391623f4d89ab9517f34c1a64c178c/72799/result1.png 320w,\n/static/ee391623f4d89ab9517f34c1a64c178c/6af66/result1.png 640w,\n/static/ee391623f4d89ab9517f34c1a64c178c/5bb8b/result1.png 749w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>I received an array called links, and the meaning of each index is:</p>\n<hr>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">0</code> - URI of API where payment’s detailed information can be checked with GET method</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">1</code> - URL that redirects to PayPal’s payment page</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">2</code> - URL that can execute payment</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now you can understand the meaning of <code class=\"language-text\">links[1]</code> explained above.

He probably passed it off as “only God would know…”\nAnd Newton said that objects with mass have gravity, which means that light has no mass and is therefore not affected by gravity at all.</p>\n<p>However, according to facts revealed in modern times, light is also affected by gravity. Didn’t we see this in the movie Interstellar? <small>(While it may not be a 100% accurate visual depiction, theoretical physicist Kip Thorne calculated general relativity and visualized it in 3D.)</small></p>\n<p>In places with tremendous gravity like black holes, this phenomenon is noticeably observed, and this is called gravitational lensing.</p>\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/59d205c9bdb4c3be36f94bb8b25cddf1/gravity-lens.gif\" alt=\"gravity lens\" width=\"100%\">\n  <br>\n  <small>Bending of light passing behind a black hole</small>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>Gravity came to be defined in Einstein’s general relativity in 1915 as the bending of spacetime by energy. So when the mass of an object in spacetime rapidly increases or decreases, waves are created in spacetime, and this is gravitational waves, which were discovered early last year.</p>\n<p>Gravitational waves generated like this are said to move at the same speed as light. So if the sun suddenly disappeared from the solar system with a poof!, the planets orbiting around the sun wouldn’t immediately escape their orbits and fly away.</p>\n<p>For example, in Earth’s case, since light from the sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, even if the sun suddenly disappeared, for about 8 minutes we would continue orbiting the position where the vanished sun was.\nThen 8 minutes later, the moment the last light that left the sun reaches Earth, Earth would break orbit.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/434fed24de68a2e16a016af2e5c94459/29d31/gravity.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"gravity\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/434fed24de68a2e16a016af2e5c94459/c08c5/gravity.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/434fed24de68a2e16a016af2e5c94459/0913d/gravity.jpg 160w,\n/static/434fed24de68a2e16a016af2e5c94459/cb69c/gravity.jpg 320w,\n/static/434fed24de68a2e16a016af2e5c94459/c08c5/gravity.jpg 640w,\n/static/434fed24de68a2e16a016af2e5c94459/29d31/gravity.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Objects with larger mass bend spacetime more</small>\n</center>\n<p>This doesn’t mean the law of universal gravitation was wrong; rather, the theory of relativity is closer to complementing what the law of universal gravitation missed. In fact, if it’s not a space with very large gravity <small>(a very bent space)</small>, the law of universal gravitation can explain it sufficiently.</p>\n<p>For example, Earth is a large sphere overall, but when we who live on Earth look around, we can’t tell whether it’s a sphere or a plane. Similarly, a space where the degree of bending is so small that it’s almost similar to Euclidean space is called pseudo-Euclidean space. And in such pseudo-Euclidean space, applying only the law of universal gravitation is sufficient. They say that even when sending the Apollo spacecraft to the moon, the law of universal gravitation alone was enough.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, finding gravity can be seen as finding the curvature of spacetime, but the simple simulation I’m trying to make is simulating situations within a very small pseudo-Euclidean space, and since it’s not a program applied to reality but literally a simulation, it can be sufficiently implemented with just the law of universal gravitation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-how-to-implement\" style=\"position:relative;\">So How to Implement?<a href=\"#so-how-to-implement\" aria-label=\"so how to implement permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>First, to explain easily, let’s assume we scatter 2 objects with random masses at random coordinates with random directions and speeds into space.\nCalculating the gravitational influence of these 2 objects is not very difficult.

Since scalars only represent physical quantities, you can know how strong gravity is but can’t know the direction of gravity.</p>\n<p>So we need to express the direction of force to properly use this formula, which is why we multiply by a vector at the end.</p>\n<p>And the reason <code class=\"language-text\">-1</code> is attached at the very front of the formula is because of the vector’s direction. The vector we multiplied at the end is the direction from object 1 toward object 2. But gravity is a force that pulls toward me, not a pushing force, so the direction of force should be from object 2 toward object 1. That’s why we multiply by <code class=\"language-text\">-1</code> again in the above formula.</p>\n<p>It looks a bit complicated, but when actually implemented in code, it’s simple.

Then can we also calculate multiple objects’ gravity influencing and receiving influence from each other?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, such <a href=\"https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%8B%A4%EC%B2%B4_%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">n-body problems</a> are one of the most difficult problems in mathematical physics, and in 1887, Henri Poincaré said it was impossible to find a general solution to three-body or greater problems.

But this isn’t a problem.</p>\n<p>For the argument of periapsis — since it simply means how far the perihelion is from the ascending node — it can be calculated from the longitude of perihelion and longitude of the ascending node that we already have. However, in this post we’ll only be finding the planet’s position on the 2D orbital plane, so we don’t actually need to calculate the argument of periapsis (which is used for determining the orbit’s orientation in 3D space).</p>\n<p>As for the time of periapsis passage, it’s essentially a time reference for finding where a planet is located at a given moment. Since the JPL data provides both values measured at J2000 and the rate of change per century, the evolution of orbital elements over time is already accounted for.</p>\n<p>The key to calculating a

Notice that the gray orbital areas are slightly different from each other, while the pink orbital areas are all equal.</p>\n<p>A planet in an elliptical orbit exhibits nonlinear motion according to Kepler’s second law — the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">law of equal areas</a>. That is, the planet moves faster near perihelion and slower near aphelion.</p>\n<p>The mean anomaly represents the angular distance between a body and the perihelion, assuming the body were transferred to a perfect circular orbit while maintaining its orbital speed and period. By simplifying the orbit to a near-circular shape, the angle representing the planet’s position increases linearly with time, making calculations simpler.</p>\n<p>Of course, if a planet’s orbital eccentricity were 0 (a perfect circle), the planet would actually move this way. But since most orbits are elliptical, the mean anomaly and eccentricity are used to correct the calculation and determine the planet’s actual motion.</p>\n<p>The mean anomaly serves as the most fundamental ingredient for calculating a planet’s position in its orbit. There are several ways to compute it, but since I already have the mean longitude and longitude of perihelion, I’ll use those.</p>\n<p>The formula for calculating the mean anomaly from mean longitude (<span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>l</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">l</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.01968em;\">l</span></span></span></span></span>) and longitude of perihelion (<span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">ω</span></span></span></span></span>) is:</p>\n<div class=\"math math-display\"><span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">M = l - \\omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">M</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7778em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.01968em;\">l</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">−</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">ω</span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ts\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-ts line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> meanAnomaly <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> currentElements<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>meanLongitude <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> currentElements<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>perihelionLongitude<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// 6238.776827293419 degrees</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>To understand the principle behind this, we need a bit more context on what mean longitude is.

It represents the central angle when the planet’s position is projected onto an imaginary circular orbit whose radius equals the semi-major axis of the actual elliptical orbit.

So while the diagram above shows Earth standing upright with the Sun orbiting at a tilt, in reality the ecliptic is the reference plane and the celestial equator is the one tilted at 23.5°.</p>\n<h3 id=\"right-ascension-and-declination\" style=\"position:relative;\">Right Ascension and Declination<a href=\"#right-ascension-and-declination\" aria-label=\"right ascension and declination permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The celestial sphere is ultimately a concept for expressing the positions of objects in the sky relative to Earth. The positions of celestial bodies are expressed using right ascension and declination.</p>\n<p>This is the same idea as using the geographic coordinate system with longitude and latitude to express a specific location on Earth. In the geographic coordinate system, latitude takes the equator as 0° and the poles as 90° to mark vertical position, while longitude takes the Greenwich Observatory as 0° and divides 180° east and 180° west for horizontal position.</p>\n<p>By the same principle, when looking up at the sky from Earth, any object on the celestial sphere can be located with just two values — right ascension and declination.</p>\n<p>Right ascension and declination are the longitude and latitude in the equatorial coordinate system, which uses the celestial equator as its baseline. Right ascension measures the counterclockwise angle from the vernal equinox to the target object along the celestial equator. Declination measures the angular distance from the celestial equator to the target object. In short, knowing the celestial equator, the vernal equinox, the right ascension, and the declination is enough to pinpoint any object on the celestial sphere. <small>(Of course, the equatorial coordinate system assumes objects exist on the two-dimensional surface of the celestial sphere, so it doesn’t define the distance to the object.)</small></p>\n<p>An interesting fact is that most celestial bodies — except for solar system objects and comets — barely move on the celestial sphere, so they have essentially fixed right ascension and declination values that make them easy to locate.</p>\n<p>Unlike geographic longitude, right ascension in the equatorial coordinate system is expressed in time units like hours and minutes. Since Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours, 1 hour of right ascension corresponds to 15°. Declination takes the celestial equator as 0° and defines the celestial north pole as +90° and south pole as -90°, so it always falls between -90° and +90°.</p>\n<p>For reference, the coordinate system centered on a ground-level observer on Earth (rather than the equator), using the observer’s horizon as the reference plane, is called the horizontal coordinate system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"orbital-terminology\" style=\"position:relative;\">Orbital Terminology<a href=\"#orbital-terminology\" aria-label=\"orbital terminology permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"ascending-node--descending-node\" style=\"position:relative;\">Ascending Node / Descending Node<a href=\"#ascending-node--descending-node\" aria-label=\"ascending node  descending node permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>A celestial body’s orbital plane is generally tilted relative to a reference plane.
