That realization is what naturally led me down this path of inquiry.</p>\n<p>What many developers find difficult when they take on a leader or manager role stems from the fact that, unlike computers, humans don’t behave logically at all.</p>\n<p>When you give a computer the command A, it understands A and executes A. Humans almost never interpret A as straightforwardly as that. Every person carries biases shaped by the environment they grew up in and the experiences they’ve accumulated, so even when you say the same thing, each person may react differently.</p>\n<p>Computers are also guaranteed to deliver the same performance under the same conditions. Humans, on the other hand, might deliver 100% performance one day and suddenly drop to 50% for entirely illogical reasons — making their behavior hard to predict.</p>\n<p>People who were recognized for their ability to work with computers — those perfectly logical machines — are suddenly asked to deal with humans, who are anything but logical. It would be stranger if they didn’t find it difficult.</p>\n<p>I, too, have experienced various types of failure — demoralizing team members through poor decisions, or failing to provide psychological support when it was needed — largely because I lacked a fundamental understanding of human nature.</p>\n<p>That’s why I came to believe that a leader needs more than just communication skills. You need a humanities-grounded understanding of yourself, of human psychology and instinct, and of organizational dynamics. To become a good leader, I thought I first needed to deepen my understanding of human nature and the characteristics that emerge when these “human objects” form a group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-a-good-leader\" style=\"position:relative;\">What Makes a Good Leader?<a href=\"#what-makes-a-good-leader\" aria-label=\"what makes a good leader permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>When I first took on the F-Lead role at Toss three years ago, and later the Frontend Chapter Lead role at Quotalab, the first question I asked myself was: “What is a good leader?”</p>\n<p>Since “good” is a subjective value judgment that inevitably differs from person to person, there’s no definitive right answer. But I believed that without my own philosophy and definition, I’d lose direction and end up being a leader who stands for nothing.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, a leader’s role is to get diverse people within an organization moving in a particular direction, in step with each other. The word “lead” implies pulling from the front, so you might think that’s what good leadership looks like. But I believe that as long as you can get people moving in the right direction, it doesn’t much matter whether you’re pulling from the front or pushing from behind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-people-move\" style=\"position:relative;\">What Makes People Move?<a href=\"#what-makes-people-move\" aria-label=\"what makes people move permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>If a leader’s role isn’t simply to control people but to get them moving in a particular direction, then the next question is: what is the force that makes people move?</p>\n<p>Fortunately, fields like psychology and education have already spent a long time discussing and experimenting with the principles of human motivation and behavior.

It states that humans are beings who motivate themselves through internal factors like interest and curiosity, actively developing their sense of self toward psychological growth and integration. The theory identifies three key needs — autonomy, competence, and relatedness — that show a strong positive correlation with intrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andragogy</a>, which is often discussed in the context of lifelong learning, understanding what drives adult behavior places particular emphasis on autonomy — the learner’s own will.</p>\n<p>Since autonomy is ultimately a psychological product of feeling that you’re acting by your own choice, I believe that to guide people’s behavior in a particular direction, you first need their empathy toward that direction.</p>\n<p>Empathy, after all, isn’t something that can be force-fed from the outside (short of brainwashing). It’s an emotion that must be self-determined and self-convinced, which makes it the most suitable emotion for triggering intrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>However, if you try to drive people’s behavior through external control factors alone — without any intrinsic motivation in place — their resistance to stress will be low when obstacles arise.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/0ff19/tree2.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"tree2\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/6af66/tree2.png\" srcset=\"/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/69538/tree2.png 160w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/72799/tree2.png 320w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/6af66/tree2.png 640w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/d9199/tree2.png 960w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/21b4d/tree2.png 1280w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/0ff19/tree2.png 2084w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Some argue that leadership through persuasion and empathy doesn't scale with larger teams,<br>\n  but organizations that large typically don't have the leader directly communicating with every member anyway.<br>\n  The leader communicates this way to middle leaders, who in turn do the same with their teams.</small>\n</center>\n<p>This is especially critical in environments like startups, where people often have to endure high workloads and long hours to achieve distant missions. Stress undermines productivity, engagement, and sense of belonging — it’s not something you can dismiss as just an individual’s problem.</p>\n<p>In other words, no matter how passionately a leader talks about their goals, team members without intrinsic motivation won’t simply fall in line and give their all. Even if they go along, their behavior is fundamentally driven by external control factors — the leader’s goals and authority — so expecting that behavior to persist under severe stress is unrealistic.</p>\n<p>External motivation also tends to focus on results rather than the act itself, giving it an instrumental quality. Some research suggests that if controlling stimuli are applied — like saying “You’re doing well following my instructions” — it can undermine autonomy and intrinsic motivation, significantly reducing productivity.</p>\n<p>This is particularly true for people in industries like IT that require creativity rather than mechanical repetition. There’s also the view that extrinsic motivators like monetary incentives are even less effective for such workers. Moreover, continuously providing extrinsic motivation risks damaging intrinsic motivation in the long run, so very careful reward design is needed. <em>(Imagine a company that provides performance-linked bonuses and then suddenly stops. Wouldn’t people start thinking “Why bother if there’s no money in it?“)</em></p>\n<p>That’s why I concluded that to keep team members highly motivated and actively contributing even in stressful environments, you need to build an environment where they feel maximum autonomy — ensuring a strong tendency toward self-actualization among the people in the organization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-people-feel-they-decided-for-themselves\" style=\"position:relative;\">Making People Feel They Decided for Themselves<a href=\"#making-people-feel-they-decided-for-themselves\" aria-label=\"making people feel they decided for themselves permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>From a leader’s perspective, it’s certainly easier to use external control factors — rewarding high performers, punishing underperformers, or leveraging organizational politics — to get people moving.</p>\n<p>But as I mentioned, intrinsic motivation plays a crucial role in driving adult behavior. Relying solely on external control factors creates an environment ripe for side effects like low morale, gossip, or people checking out entirely.</p>\n<p>Unlike material resources, human resources are entities capable of emotion and thought, making them difficult to predict and control through a mechanistic lens.</p>\n<p>So leaders need to create an environment where intrinsic motivation can emerge. There are many methods — appropriate delegation of decision-making authority, environments where people can taste small wins (technical and business), clear goals and expectations — but among these, I placed the most weight on the value of autonomy.</p>\n<p>The autonomy a team member feels at work comes from things like exercising decision-making authority over their product, a leader who asks for opinions rather than issuing directives, and being given choices and allowed to make their own selections. It’s about the team member feeling — or actually experiencing — that they’re contributing to the organization through their own autonomous agency.</p>\n<p>Since autonomy isn’t a clear-cut sensation like pain but rather a psychological awareness of exercising one’s own agency, even if team members are unknowingly moving in the direction the organization wants, as long as they believe they have autonomy, that autonomy is effectively secured.</p>\n<p>There’s also substantial empirical research — both domestic and international — showing that work autonomy has a significant positive correlation with organizational trust, job satisfaction, engagement, and performance. In other words, the fact that autonomy can trigger intrinsic motivation appears to hold regardless of commonly cited East-West differences in thinking.</p>\n<p>Of course, given the nature of a company, you can’t guarantee 100% autonomy for everyone. But as I mentioned, autonomy is a psychological awareness rather than an objective sensation — so even just showing that the leader supports team members’ autonomy can have an effect. Alternatively, depending on the leader’s skill, it may be possible to help internalize and integrate externally assigned motivations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"actions-leaders-can-take-to-strengthen-team-autonomy\" style=\"position:relative;\">Actions Leaders Can Take to Strengthen Team Autonomy<a href=\"#actions-leaders-can-take-to-strengthen-team-autonomy\" aria-label=\"actions leaders can take to strengthen team autonomy permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>So what specific methods can strengthen team members’ autonomy?</p>\n<p>I believe the first step is to analyze and diagnose the current state of the organization — specifically, what motivates each person. Since autonomy is a precondition for creating intrinsic motivation to boost productivity and engagement, if people already have intrinsic motivation, there’s not much to worry about. <em>(Though in practice, when you actually observe and analyze, surprisingly few people operate on intrinsic motivation.)</em></p>\n<p>You could ask directly in 1-on-1 meetings — “Do you find your current work enjoyable?” or “Why did you become a developer?” — but personally, I prefer analyzing information that comes up in casual conversation.</p>\n<p>The reason is that the moment you ask someone a question, they might develop biased thinking around that question. Combined with the inherent discomfort of meeting with a leader and the collectivist tendency of not wanting to stand out, they may not share their true feelings.

But I believed that preserving team members’ intrinsic motivation mattered more than the speed gained from top-down announcements. That’s why I chose to collect feedback before making decisions. Besides, in a small organization of just 5–6 people like the one I led, the leader actively gathering opinions doesn’t significantly slow things down. <em>(And no matter how talented the leader, it’s hard to beat collective intelligence.)</em></p>\n<p>I also judged that if people are given the chance to participate in decision-making, they’re more likely to empathize with the final decision compared to a simple announcement. Even if their opinion wasn’t adopted, they had the chance to voice it and hear the reasoning behind why it wasn’t — a form of equality of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Of course, depending on the team member’s personality and situation, some may find it hard to voice their opinions. But since the organization provided ample opportunity to speak up, whether or not they actually do so is their own choice, which doesn’t significantly violate their autonomy.</p>\n<p>However, the leader’s response should differ depending on whether someone’s reluctance stems from an internal characteristic like an introverted personality, or from external factors — like being new to the company, having recently been criticized, or having been burned by office politics at a previous job.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/b4294/pressure.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"pressure\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/b4294/pressure.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/0913d/pressure.jpg 160w,\n/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/cb69c/pressure.jpg 320w,\n/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/b4294/pressure.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This is a common preconception among workers in Korean corporate culture,<br>so don't expect people to speak up enthusiastically just because you ask for opinions.</small>\n</center>\n<p>In the former case, if someone’s personality simply doesn’t incline them toward asserting their views, pushing them to share opinions probably won’t change anything. You can change simple behaviors like habits, but altering the personality of someone already in adulthood is no easy feat. <em>(This is why hiring well from the start is so important.)</em></p>\n<p>In this case, the person may be in a state of amotivation or may not have clearly established their growth direction, so you need to find some motivating factor through conversation and at least provide extrinsic motivation.

If I had a good idea, I’d propose it to the relevant squad’s engineer and delegate the choice to them. Many organizations withhold decision-making authority from juniors or new hires, but I delegated trust and authority regardless of experience level.</p>\n<p>I had two main reasons for this. First, to create intrinsic motivation through autonomy, as discussed above. Second, to ensure that the emotions around success and failure from decision outcomes were felt most strongly by the team member themselves.</p>\n<p>I believe all humans grow through failure, so each individual’s sense and emotional response to failure within the team is extremely important.</p>\n<p>But if a leader gives specific instructions, the emotions around success and failure no longer belong to the team member. The leader held the final decision-making authority, and the team member merely followed orders — so the emotional weight of outcomes tends to be attributed to the decision-maker, the leader. <em>(If the leader also has a self-serving bias — taking credit for successes and blaming others or circumstances for failures — team members’ frustration will only grow. In the worst case, the team implodes.)</em></p>\n<p>When a team member makes their own decision and faces the consequences, the sense of responsibility they feel is far greater than when the leader made the call for them. I believe this is the most fundamental element of what people commonly call the “autonomy and responsibility” principle.</p>\n<p>However, if you design this environment and then blame team members for their failures, that’s a shortcut to disaster. This kind of environment must be accompanied by a value like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone can fail. It’s okay to fail.</p>\n<p>But if you do fail, make sure you extract the lessons learned and share them so your colleagues don’t repeat the same mistakes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>New hires and junior members especially tend to fear failure, so the leader absolutely needs to say this explicitly. You could also intentionally show small failures of your own as the leader, though this approach can backfire and erode trust if you haven’t built enough rapport yet — so read the room.</p>\n<p>These kinds of practices aren’t common in typical Korean companies, so some team members may be experiencing them for the first time. In such cases, side effects can occur — people being afraid of being the decision-maker, or beating themselves up for not expressing their thoughts well — requiring appropriate responses from the leader.</p>\n<p>From the leader’s perspective, when you delegate final decision-making authority, you’re still on the hook if things go wrong. Delegating authority doesn’t free you from responsibility for the team’s failures. In other words, by delegating final decision-making to team members, you deliberately create a situation where you have responsibility without authority. <del>(You have to dig your own grave.)</del></p>\n<p>Some leaders might feel anxious about losing control when they delegate decision-making authority. But if you’ve built sufficient rapport or present solid logical reasoning, most team members will seriously consider the leader’s proposals before making their decision — and in the end, things often go the way the leader suggested anyway.</p>\n<p>What matters, then, is the leader’s persuasive ability and the trust they’ve built with team members. If a team member doesn’t follow my suggestion, I think it’s healthier to reflect on whether I failed to persuade them, rather than to blame them.</p>\n<p>Over a year and a half, I delegated final decision-making authority to various frontend engineers. Regardless of experience level, anyone who passed the three-month probation could participate as an interviewer, among other policies. Apart from occasional cases where someone was nervous about having decision-making responsibility, it was rarely a problem. In most cases, through chapter-wide discussions or suggestions from me or other colleagues, people made good decisions.</p>\n<p>For interview process participation in particular, there were reactions like “Am I really qualified to evaluate someone?” But starting with résumé screening, they quickly adapted — and some even ended up proposing improvements to fill gaps in the interview process.</p>\n<p>If anything, this decision-making structure enabled the frontend chapter to make decisions quickly, which translated to increased overall performance.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/019a6/commits.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 27.500000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAyUlEQVR42p2QzY7CMAyE8z6U5o/SNkmTLELaQuHGEd7/MYZJumIlJC4cPo09cWzLYqNHfI16jx2E3Ee0u/Ad+wDZUy11KPEEoUpDGz7z3sSsutUBKnuoE5k99NXX5kJ2Eyd5tP06sVLint7wl3e+si2bRH6+OMjkYW4O9kHuK3rx3HBIMD8J+hChU4Q9ZJgjYW6OqXomZtiUoQNrf1mzTLBzwm6hf06ENXNEd80Qjfk/bFNx9cCNcq+jv3zWNpLaru81lmPNixbvCdRBw12y6juTAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"commits\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/6af66/commits.png\" srcset=\"/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/69538/commits.png 160w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/72799/commits.png 320w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/6af66/commits.png 640w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/d9199/commits.png 960w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/21b4d/commits.png 1280w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/019a6/commits.png 1818w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>You can roughly gauge performance by looking at the trend of commits merged to main.<br>I joined in March 2022, and the frontend chapter only grew by three people over that period.</small>\n</center>\n<p>While some expressed concern about this system, the reality is that I only delegated final decision-making — I didn’t tell anyone to be a dictator. Any team member’s decision-making process was naturally accompanied by suggestions and feedback from other team members. The pressure of being responsible for their own decisions also compelled them to strive for the most rational choices possible.</p>\n<p>This feedback came in various forms — code reviews, Slack discussions, or offline conversations — and the decision-maker would hear diverse opinions from colleagues before making the final call. Most problems get caught through this process.</p>\n<p>There may be small failures early on when you first delegate, but as I discussed, since the failure resulted from their own choice, they’ll naturally work to avoid repeating the same mistakes. The motivation for this effort might be extrinsic — not wanting to lose colleagues’ trust, or self-satisfaction — but humans inherently possess a need for competence, a desire to be recognized by others. Nobody wants to look incompetent, so they inevitably make the effort.</p>\n<p>Of course, if someone keeps repeating the same failures, you need to provide appropriate feedback while being careful not to let them lose too much sense of competence through self-deprecation like “I’m hopeless at everything.” Just be honest — acknowledge what they’re doing well and suggest working together on areas that need improvement. <em>(I found myself saying this kind of thing a lot when helping colleagues strategize for passing their probation period.)</em></p>\n<p>By delegating decision-making authority to the engineer who knows their squad’s situation best and supporting them, you remove the funnel of reporting to and getting approval from someone — increasing decision speed. You accelerate growth by letting team members directly experience the emotions of failure. And in the long run, you strengthen team members’ autonomy and competence.</p>\n<p>However, this kind of decision-making structure carries a high risk of devolving into everyone-does-their-own-thing chaos, so clear goal alignment across the entire team is absolutely essential.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-discuss-the-chapters-reason-for-existence-and-mission-together\" style=\"position:relative;\">Always Discuss the Chapter’s Reason for Existence and Mission Together<a href=\"#always-discuss-the-chapters-reason-for-existence-and-mission-together\" aria-label=\"always discuss the chapters reason for existence and mission together permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The third value I upheld was always discussing the frontend chapter’s reason for existence and mission together as a team. An organization, by definition, is a group formed to achieve goals that can’t be accomplished alone — its very raison d’être comes from its mission.</p>\n<p>If people have no say in something this important, it’s only natural for their sense of belonging to decline. So when defining the frontend chapter’s purpose, I made every effort to incorporate as many team members’ opinions as possible.</p>\n<p>These missions were typically defined in OKR format, and I made sure discussions focused more on the Objective — the essence of the mission — than on Key Results, which are merely indicators of whether the mission has been achieved.</p>\n<p>A clear goal like “we are a team organized to achieve X, our mission is Y, and our strategy to achieve it is Z” is essentially a belief about why the frontend chapter can meaningfully exist within the company.</p>\n<p>If this belief wavers, sentiment like “I don’t even know why the frontend chapter exists” can form both inside and outside the chapter. This leads to declining morale and sense of belonging, which in turn erodes competence and intrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>Another reason organizational mission matters so much is that running an organization isn’t like StarCraft, where you just hotkey your units and attack-move. It’s more like Overwatch or PUBG — games where diverse humans with individual decision-making abilities come together to fight toward a shared objective.</p>\n<p>StarCraft units don’t question orders. They faithfully execute whatever command is given, even if you send naked Marines without Medics into a field of Lurkers for certain annihilation. That’s why a single player can comfortably control dozens of units with 100% compliance.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/e811e/starcraft.webp\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnQAAABXRUJQVlA4IGgAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAKZMiOSZ6N48AAP6D8LCXxye6Sw9VzNZuMt908H/TIL5d9rtu/M2Jh7bGriXafJbW3eH9HIkK85FXn/wNpS2QjFIPbwt1UH2+10oAAA=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"starcraft\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/0ba47/starcraft.webp\" srcset=\"/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/60a22/starcraft.webp 160w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/4c812/starcraft.webp 320w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/0ba47/starcraft.webp 640w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/e46b2/starcraft.webp 960w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/e811e/starcraft.webp 1060w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>If you mistake organizational management for StarCraft, team pushback is inevitable.</small>\n</center>\n<p>But in games like Overwatch or PUBG, calling out orders is critical. These are games where multiple humans form a team to achieve objectives together.</p>\n<p>When you’re supposed to push the payload together but one teammate keeps charging into enemy lines for kills and dying, while another is left guarding the payload alone and getting overwhelmed — the game grinds to a halt. The leader needs to call out clearly: “Everyone focus on pushing the payload,” “The rest of you draw aggro from the payload while Genji takes out Widowmaker.” <em>(Unless the team is deep in the lower ranks, this shouldn’t happen too often… I think.)</em></p>\n<p>Real organizational management works similarly. Games at least provide a clear built-in objective, so there’s no need to think about goals. Real organizations have to align on goals first. Without this process, you end up with a team in name only — where one person is playing Overwatch and another is playing PUBG.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/e1596/star.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"star\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/c08c5/star.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/0913d/star.jpg 160w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/cb69c/star.jpg 320w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/c08c5/star.jpg 640w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/6a068/star.jpg 960w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/eea4a/star.jpg 1280w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/e1596/star.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>An organization's goal is the coordinates of a star everyone navigates toward.<br>If everyone doesn't have the same star's coordinates in their heads, the voyage will struggle.</small>\n</center>\n<p>That’s why I made sure that important values like the frontend chapter’s purpose and mission were always defined through everyone’s participation, input, and discussion.

I believe that a leader and team members aren’t in a hierarchical relationship — they simply have different roles. And to perform well in each of those roles, you inevitably need help from your colleagues.</p>\n<p>A mutual feedback environment also enhances team members’ autonomy by giving them the power to influence the leader’s direction. Of course, simply exchanging feedback isn’t enough — the leader needs to express gratitude after receiving feedback and demonstrate genuine receptiveness. <em>(And if you disagree with the feedback, just explain your reasoning in detail.)</em></p>\n<p>No human is perfect. Even the most talented person has both strengths and weaknesses, and no matter how long someone has worked, they’re inevitably a beginner in areas outside their expertise.</p>\n<p>I have clear strengths, but I also have clear weaknesses. My knowledge in areas outside frontend development — the field I’ve spent years in — is relatively limited, and I can’t claim to be an expert in everything.</p>\n<p>I imagine the same is true for most people. A single, small human can’t possibly be good at everything in this world.</p>\n<p>In very small startups with around ten employees, a talented leader might handle many things simultaneously like a firefighter. But as organizations grow, that becomes increasingly difficult, and failing to delegate properly can produce various side effects.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in such leader-dependent structures, if the leader isn’t exceptionally capable, the entire organization’s performance crumbles along with them. Active mutual feedback can serve as a means to grow the leader when they’re falling short, or to hedge against the leader’s insufficient decision-making ability.</p>\n<p>However, in traditional companies where leaders are often equated with bosses, it’s hard to establish a robust feedback culture unless the leader genuinely possesses the capacity to accept feedback and the ability to separate feedback from their emotions.</p>\n<p>Feedback receptiveness connects to metacognition — and since metacognition is the high-level concept of “knowing what you don’t know,” it’s not easy to cultivate on your own. Most people find themselves in a state where they don’t even know what they don’t know, yet think “I know a lot” — a kind of Sophist thinking.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, I believe the best way to develop metacognitive ability is through team members’ feedback. In practice, as I worked in a leadership role and talked with many people, I often found significant gaps between how I saw myself and how others saw me.</p>\n<p>Here’s my own example. The left column is my self-assessment; the right is feedback from colleagues:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>My Assessment</th>\n<th>Others’ Assessment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Not very emotionally volatile</td>\n<td>I can make decisions without emotional interference</td>\n<td>Your tone is too cold. We’d like to see more inclusion, not exclusion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I tend to share opinions first</td>\n<td>I express my thoughts clearly</td>\n<td>Your expression is so strong that it’s hard to voice opposing views</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I don’t show personal emotions at work</td>\n<td>I clearly separate work and personal life</td>\n<td>You seem unapproachable and lacking warmth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These value judgments inherently include a kind of self-serving bias, so one tends to judge oneself leniently and others strictly. Personal rapport can introduce bias as well. I’m just another human who can’t escape these biases — which is why my self-assessment was skewed positively.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, one thing matters: a leader is in a position where they need to earn others’ trust. So rather than how you see yourself, what matters more is how others perceive your characteristics — and you need to know that clearly and respond accordingly.</p>\n<p>My point isn’t “don’t fall into bias.” While I’m no psychology expert, I believe it’s nearly impossible to completely eliminate these biases.</p>\n<p>What matters is the leader recognizing: “I have biases and errors,” “I’m not that perfect.”</p>\n<p>A leader is human, so naturally there will be areas of strength and areas of weakness. But if you’re not clearly aware of your strengths and weaknesses and try to micromanage beyond your competence or grab excessive decision-making authority, the result can be worse for the organization overall — and it can create problems in earning team members’ trust.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/7bf67/control.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 68.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"control\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/c08c5/control.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/0913d/control.jpg 160w,\n/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/cb69c/control.jpg 320w,\n/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/c08c5/control.jpg 640w,\n/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/7bf67/control.jpg 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Humans tend to think in ways biased by their experiences,<br>\n  so if your early career was spent in a control-heavy organization, your leadership may unconsciously lean toward control as well — which is why metacognition matters.</small>\n</center>\n<p>A leader isn’t someone who controls team members — they’re someone complementary to them. After all, the role of leader can only exist because team members exist.</p>\n<p>So you need to learn how others perceive you through their feedback, and by taking appropriate action items, shape how you appear to your team in the right direction.</p>\n<p>But stepping out of the ideal and into reality, you’ll find that in most organizations where feedback culture hasn’t taken root, people are afraid to transparently share their thoughts about others. Especially in Eastern cultures that value the group over the individual, a “leader” is often equated with a “commander” — so breaking this preconception is important.</p>\n<p>That’s why leaders need to actively communicate that they want feedback, and deliberately — even exaggeratedly — demonstrate a receptive attitude.</p>\n<p>I held coffee chats with everyone in the frontend chapter every two weeks, and at the end of each session, I always asked for feedback. I consistently made explicit statements like: “Giving me feedback helps me grow,” “I’m not perfect either, and I want to improve my weaknesses through feedback,” “Just as you want to grow, I’m just another developer who wants to grow too.” My goal was to make team members think, “This person is genuinely obsessed with feedback…”</p>\n<p>Of course, extracting meaningful feedback every two weeks isn’t easy — most sessions were a parade of “Nothing in particular.” But by persistently maintaining this practice, I was able to receive meaningful feedback from time to time. <em>(Like being told to come in earlier in the morning…)</em></p>\n<p>When I received feedback I resonated with, I’d establish action items to address it and always share the results afterward. Many things didn’t actually improve, but it was a way of actively signaling that I didn’t ignore their feedback.</p>\n<p>It varies somewhat by personality, but in an authority-oriented culture like Korea’s, giving feedback to a leader takes considerable courage. So naturally, the person receiving feedback should express gratitude for the courage it took, and demonstrate that every word was taken to heart.</p>\n<p>Even if you didn’t agree with the feedback, always express gratitude first for the courage it took, and then explain why you didn’t fully resonate with it.</p>\n<p>Be careful, though: reacting emotionally to feedback, or saying “thank you” but then showing no action items or sharing no follow-through — these patterns will cause team members to develop the mindset “Talking to this person won’t change anything,” and they’ll eventually stop speaking up.</p>\n<p>If more and more colleagues start feeling this way, the organization can become like a boiling pressure cooker — ready to blow at any moment.

기인한다.</p>\n<p>A라는 명령을 내리면 그대로 A라고 알아듣고 수행하는 컴퓨터와 다르게 인간은 A라고 이야기를 했을 때 곧이 곧대로 A라고 이해하는 경우가 거의 없다. 인간은 각자 자라온 환경이나 지금까지 겪어온 경험에 따른 편향을 가지고 있을 수 밖에 없기 때문에, 똑같이 A라고 이야기를 해도 각자 다르게 반응할 수 있기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>또한 컴퓨터는 동일한 환경이라면 동일한 퍼포먼스를 내는 것이 보장되지만, 인간은 평소에 100%의 퍼포먼스를 잘 내다가도 논리적이지 않은 이유로 인해 갑자기 50%의 퍼포먼스를 내는 등 행동에 대한 예측이 어렵다.</p>\n<p>애초에 컴퓨터라는 계산기를 잘 다루는 능력으로 인정받았던 사람들이 어느 날 갑자기 전혀 논리적이지 않은 인간이라는 객체를 다뤄야 하니, 어렵지 않다고 하면 더 이상할 것이다.</p>\n<p>필자 또한 인간에 대한 근본적 이해가 부족했던 탓에 잘못된 의사결정으로 인한 팀원들의 사기를 저하시키거나 심리적 지지를 해줘야 하는 순간에 그러지 못해 상처를 입히는 등 여러가지 유형의 실패를 경험했다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 리더에게는 단지 커뮤니케이션 뿐 아니라 나 스스로에 대한 이해와 인간 본연의 심리와 본능, 조직의 특성에 대한 이해와 같은 인문학적인 소양까지도 필요하다고 느꼈고, 좋은 리더가 되기 위해 우선 인간 본연에 대한 이해와 이러한 인간 객체들이 집단을 이루었을 때 어떤 특성을 띄는지에 대한 이해도를 높혀야 한다고 생각했다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"좋은-리더란-무엇일까\"

이상 누군가가 외부에서 강제로 주입할 수 있는 것이 아니며, 스스로가 결정하고 납득해야하는 감정이기 때문에 내재적인 동기를 유발시키기에 가장 적합한 감정이기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 내재된 동기가 없는 상태에서 이러한 외적 통제 요인으로만 사람들의 행동을 이끌어낸다면 그 행동을 수행하기에 방해가 되는 스트레스가 주어졌을 때 스트레스에 대한 저항력이 낮을 수 밖에 없다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a

<small>사람이 많아지면 설득과 공감을 통한 리더십이 불가능하다는 의견도 있지만<br>\n  어차피 그 정도로 큰 조직이면 리더가 매번 모든 팀원과 직접 소통하는 구조가 아닐 가능성이 높다.<br>\n  리더는 중간 리더들에게, 중간 리더들은 팀원들에게 같은 방식으로 소통하면 된다.<br>\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>특히 스타트업과 같이 먼 곳에 있는 미션을 달성하기 위해 높은 업무 강도, 긴 업무 시간 등 거친 상황을 감수해야하는 상황이 발생하기 쉬운 환경이라면 더더욱 스트레스 저항력에 대한 고민이 필요하다. 스트레스는 조직 구성원의 생산성, 몰입도, 소속감 등을 저해하는 요소이기 때문에 단순히 한 인간의 문제로만 치부하고 넘어갈 수 있는 문제가 아니라고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>결국 내재적 동기가 없는 팀원에게 열심히 리더의 목표를 이야기한다고 사람들이 알잘딱 따라주거나 열심히 해주지는 않는다는 이야기이다. 혹은 어찌어찌 따라주더라도 근본적으로 리더의 목표와 권위라는 외적 통제 요인으로부터 비롯된 행동이니, 팀원들에게 가혹한 스트레스가 주어지는 환경에서 그 행동을 오랜 시간 지속하기를 기대하기란 어려울 것이다.</p>\n<p>또한 외재적 동기는 행위 자체보다는 결과에 초점을 맞추는 경향이 있기 때문에 도구적인 특성이 강하며, 만약 “제가 말씀드린대로 잘 해주고 계시네요”와 같이 통제 목적의 자극이 주어진다면 자율성과 내재적 동기가 훼손되어 생산성이 크게 떨어진다는 시각 또한 존재한다.</p>\n<p>특히 IT와 같이 기계적인 업무를 반복하는 것이 아닌 창의력이 요구되는 업계에 종사하는 사람인 경우, 인센티브와 같은 물적 보상에서 비롯된 외재적 동기가 더욱 힘을 쓰지 못 한다는 의견도 있다. 게다가 이러한 외재적 동기를 지속적으로 부여하게 되면 장기적으로 내재적 동기를 손상시킬 위험도 있기에 이런 방법을 사용할 때는 상당히 정교한 보상 설계가 필요하다. <small>(회사가 성과와 연동된 인센티브를 주다가 갑자기 끊는다고 생각해보자. “어차피 돈도 안 나오는데 왜 함”이라고 생각하게 되지 않을까?)</small></p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 팀원들이 스트레스풀한 환경에서도 높은 동기를 유지하고 적극적으로 조직에 기여를 하게 만들기 위해서는 최대한 높은 자율성을 느낄 수 있는 환경을 구축하여 조직 내 인간 객체들의 높은 자기실현 경향성을 보장해주어야 한다고

사람에게는 벌을 주거나, 혹은 정치와 같은 외적 통제 요인을 사용하여 사람들을 움직이게 만드는 것이 더 편하기는 하다.</p>\n<p>하지만 앞서 이야기했듯 성인의 행동 유발 원리에는 내적 동기가 꽤나 중요한 부분을 차지하기 때문에 이런 외적 통제 요인만을 부여하게 되면 사기가 떨어지거나, 뒷담화가 생기거나, 조직의 상황에 관심을 끊어버리는 등과 같은 사이드이펙트가 터지기 쉬운 환경이 될 위험이 존재한다.</p>\n<p>물적자원과 다르게 인적자원은 각각의 객체가 감정을 가지고 사고할 수 있기 때문에 기계론적인 시각으로는 예측과 통제가 어려운 것이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 리더는 사람들의 내적 동기가 유발될 수 있는 환경을 마련해주어야 하는데, 이런 환경을 구축하기 위해서 적절한 의사결정권의 위임, 기술/비즈니스적으로 Small Win을 맛볼 수 있는 환경, 명확한 목표/기대치 제시 등 여러가지 방법들을 사용해볼 수 있지만, 그 중에서 필자는 자율성의 가치에 가장 무게를 두었다.</p>\n<p>팀원이 회사에서 느끼는 자율성이란 결국 자신이 맡은 제품에 대한 의사결정권 행사, 통보가 아닌 의견을 물어보는 리더의 태도, 팀원에게 몇 가지 선택권을 주고 직접 선택하게 하는 행위 등을 통해 팀원이 자신의 자율성을 행사하여 스스로 조직에 기여하고 있다는 느낌을 받거나 혹은 실제로 기여하는 것을 의미한다.</p>\n<p>어차피 자율성은 통증과 같은 명확한 감각이 아니라 자신이 스스로 자율성을 행사하고 있다고 믿는 심리적인 자각이므로, 팀원들이 알게 모르게 조직이 원하는 방향으로 움직이고 있더라도 본인이 자율성이 있다고 믿는다면 자율성이 확보된다고 보는 것이다.</p>\n<p>또한 국내와 해외 관계없이 업무 자율성이 조직에 대한 신뢰나 업무 만족도, 몰입도, 성과에 대해 유의미한 정적 상관관계를 보인다는 실증 연구 결과도 이미 많이 존재한다. 즉, 자율성이 내재적 동기를 불러일으킬 수 있다는 사실에는 흔히 이야기하는 서양과 동양의 사고 방식 차이와도 큰 관련이 없다고 볼 수 있다.</p>\n<p>물론 회사라는 조직의 특성 상 모든 인간의 자율성을 100% 보장해줄 수는 없겠지만, 앞서 이야기했듯 자율성은 객관적 감각이 아닌 심리적인 자각이므로 리더가 팀원의 자율성을 지지하는 행위를 보이는 것만으로도 어느 정도 효과를 볼 수도 있으며, 또는 리더의 역량에 따라 조직으로부터 부여되는 외재적 동기들을 내재화하여 통합할 수 있도록 만들어 볼 수도 있을 것이다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"팀원들의-자율성을-강화할-수-있는-리더의-행동\" style=\"position:relative;\">팀원들의 자율성을 강화할 수 있는 리더의 행동<a

선결조건이니 이미 사람들이 내재적 동기를 가지고 있다면 딱히 큰 고민을 할 필요가 없기 때문이다. <small>(근데 막상 분석과 관찰을 해보면 생각보다 내재적 동기를 기반으로 움직이는 사람은 별로 없는 것 같다)</small></p>\n<p>팀원들과 1 on 1 미팅을 해보며 “현재 하고 계신 업무가 재밌으신가요”, “개발자가 왜 되셨나요”와 같이 직접적인 질문을 통해 물어보는 방법도 있지만, 개인적으로 필자는 사담에서 나오는 정보를 토대로 분석을 진행하는 편이다.</p>\n<p>왜냐하면 내가 상대방에게 질문을 던지는 순간 상대방이 그 질문에 편향된 사고를 하거나 리더와의 미팅이라는 불편한 자리의 특성과 괜히 모난 돌이 되기 싫다는 동양 특유의 집단주의가 맞물려 자신의 본래 마음을 100% 털어놓지 않을 가능성도 있기 때문이다. 특히 상대방을 편향시키지 않는 질문 방법은 유저 리서치, 인터뷰 등 상대방에게 정보를 얻어내야 하는 상황에서 굉장히 중요한데, 이게 생각보다 쉽지 않다.</p>\n<p>그런 이유로 필자는 1 on 1 미팅 같은 오피셜한 시간보다는 평소 함께 담배 한 대 피는 상황, 카페에서 수다떠는 상황, 퇴근 후 같이 저녁먹는 상황처럼 편안한 환경에서 나오는 정보들이 더 솔직하고 가치있는 정보일 가능성이 높다고 생각한 것이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;

선택한 이유가 “개발이 재밌어서”인 경우 아직 그 학습동기를 마음 속에 가지고 있어서인 것 같기도 하고, 아무래도 나이가 더 많은 시니어의 경우에는 자신의 흥미 외에도 책임져야 할 일들이 많아서인 것 같기도 하다.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>어쨌든 필자가 정의한 리더의 역할은 외적조절, 내사조절, 동일시조절, 통합조절과 같은 외재적 동기에

최근 누군가에게 비난을 받았거나, 전직장에서 의견을 밝혔다가 정치질을 당했거나하는 외적 요인으로부터 그 행동이 가로막히고 있는 것인지에 따라 리더의 행동도 달라져야 한다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;

선택권을 위임한다. 많은 조직들이 특히 주니어나 신입 엔지니어에게는 의사결정권을 주지 않는 경우가 많은데, 필자는 경력 여하와 상관없이 일단 신뢰를 보내고 의사결정권을 위임했다.</p>\n<p>이런 정책을 사용한 이유는 크게 2가지였는데, 첫 번째는 앞서 이야기했던 자율권에서 비롯된 내재적 동기를 만들어내기 위해서이고 두 번째는 의사결정으로 인해 파생된 결과로 인한 성공과 실패에 대한 감정을 오롯이 팀원이 더 강하게 느끼도록 하기 위해서이다.</p>\n<p>필자는 모든 인간은 실패를 통해 성장한다고 생각하기에 팀 내의 개개인들이 느끼는 실패에 대한 감각과 감정 또한 굉장히 중요하다고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>하지만 리더가 팀원에게 특정한 지시를 한다면 그 액션에 대한 성공과 실패에 대한 감정은 팀원의 것이 아니게 된다. 리더가 해당 액션에 대한 최종의사결정권을 가졌고 팀원은 그저 타인이 시키는대로 한 것이기 때문에 결과에 대한 감정들 또한 의사결정권자인 리더에게 강하게 귀속될 가능성이 높다. <small>(만약 잘 되면 내 탓, 안 되면 남이나 상황 탓을 하는 자기고양편향까지 가진 리더라면 팀원들의 불만은 더 커질 것이다. 최악의 경우에는 팀이 폭파된다.)</small></p>\n<p>그러나 팀원이 스스로 의사결정을 내린 이후 발생한 결과에 대해 스스로가 느끼는 책임감은 리더가 의사결정을 해주었을 때에 비해 크게 다가올 것이다. 필자는 이것이 흔히 이야기하는 자율과 책임 원칙의 가장 근본이 되는 요소라고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>다만 이런 환경을 설계해놓고 실패한 팀원을 비난해버리면 그야말로 망하는 지름길이니, 이런 환경을 구성하려면 반드시 아래와 같은 가치관이 동반되어야 한다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>누구나 다 실패할 수 있어요. 실패해도 됩니다.</p>\n<p>다만 실패했다면 Lesson &#x26; Learn만 확실하게 뽑고 다른 동료들이 똑같은 삽질을 하지 않도록 공유해주세요.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>특히 신규입사자나 신입은 실패를 두려워하는 경우가 많으니 리더가 이런 이야기를 반드시 해줘야 한다. 혹은 의도적으로 리더가 작은 실패를 하는 모습을 보여줘도 되지만, 이 방법은 팀원에게서 라포가 어느 정도 쌓여있는 상황이 아니면 오히려 신뢰를 잃어버릴 수도 있으니 상황 봐가면서 하자.</p>\n<p>이런 행동들은 대한민국의 일반적인 기업들에서 흔히 볼 수 있는 리더십은 아니기 때문에 이런 경험을 처음 해보는 팀원들도 있기 마련이다. 이 경우 자신이 의사결정권자라는 사실을 두려워하거나 자신의 생각을 제대로 표현하지 못해 자책하는 등 사이드 이펙트도 발생할 수 있으니 이에 따른 리더의 대응이 필요할 수 있다.</p>\n<p>또한 리더의 입장에서는 이런 식으로 최종의사결정권을 위임했을 때 뭔가가 잘못되면 결국 책임을 져야한다. 의사결정권을 위임했다고 해서 팀의 실패에 대한 책임에서까지 자유로운 것은 아니기 때문이다. 즉, 최종의사결정권을 팀원에게 위임함으로써 권한은 없고 책임만 있는 상황을 자기가 스스로 만들어야 한다는 부담을 져야한다. <small><del>(내 무덤을 스스로 파야한다)</del></small></p>\n<p>또한 리더가 팀원에게 의사결정권을 위임하게되면 더 이상 팀을 컨트롤하지 못 한다는 불안감을 가지게 될 수도 있는데, 어차피 어느 정도 라포를 쌓았거나 충분한 논리적 근거를 제시한다면 팀원들 대부분은 리더가 제안한 내용에 대해서 진지하게 받아들인 상태로 의사결정을 검토하기 때문에 결국은 리더가 제안한 대로 되는 경우가 많다.</p>\n<p>즉, 리더의 설득 역량과 팀원으로부터 쌓아놓은 신뢰 자산이 중요한 것이다. 필자는 내 말을 안 들어주는 팀원이 있다면 그 팀원을 책망하는 것보다 내가 설득하지 못한 것은 아닌지 한번 생각해보는 것이 더 건강한 사고라고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>이렇게 필자는 1년 반 동안 다양한 프론트엔드 엔지니어에게 최종의사결정권을 위임했었고, 경력과 관계없이 3개월의 수습기간을 통과하면 누구든 면접관으로 참여할 수 있는 등의 정책을 사용했었지만, 의사결정 경험이 부족해서 조금 두려워하는 케이스를 제외하면 별로 문제가 되었던 적은 없었다. 대부분의 경우 챕터 내 논의 또는 필자나 다른 동료의 제안을 통해 좋은 의사결정을 하셨기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>특히 인터뷰 프로세스 참여의 경우 “제가 감히 평가를 할 수 있을까요” 뭐 이런 반응도 있었는데, 처음에는 서류 평가부터 참여해보시더니 금방 적응하셔서 나중에는 인터뷰 프로세스에 대한 허점을 보완할 수 있는 제안까지 하시는 경우도 있었다.</p>\n<p>오히려 이러한 의사결정체제로 인해 프론트엔드 챕터는 빠른 속도의 의사결정을 해나갈 수 있었고, 이는 챕터 전체의 퍼포먼스 증가로 이어졌다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a

위임했을 뿐이지 독재를 하라고 한 게 아니기 때문에 어떤 팀원의 의사결정과정에는 반드시 다른 팀원들의 제안과 피드백이 동반되기 마련이고, 본인이 결정한 내용에 대해서 책임을 져야한다는 부담도 있어 최대한 합리적인 의사결정을 하기 위해 노력할 수 밖에 없다.</p>\n<p>이러한 피드백은 코드 리뷰, 슬랙 채널 또는 오프라인에서의 토론과 같은 다양한 형태로 주어지며 의사결정권자는 동료들의 다양한 의견을 듣고 최종의사결정을 내리게 된다. 이 과정에서 대부분의 문제는 잡히기 마련이다.</p>\n<p>처음 위임을 했을 때는 작은 실패들이 있을 수 있지만, 앞서 이야기한대로 결국 본인이 직접 선택한 행위로 인해 실패한 것이므로 다음에는 같은 실패를 반복하지 않기 위해 당연히 노력할 것이다. 이 노력에 대한 동기는 동료들의 신뢰를 잃지 않기 위해서, 자기만족 등 외재적 동기일 수 있지만 인간은 누구나 어느 정도는 타인에게 인정받고 싶어하는 유능감을 지니고 있어 무능한 사람으로 보이고 싶어하지 않기 때문에 노력할 수 밖에 없다.</p>\n<p>물론 이 과정 속에서 계속 같은 실패를 반복한다면 적절한 방법으로 피드백을 줘야하며, “난 뭘 해도 안 되는 놈이야”와 같은 자기모멸감 때문에 유능감을 너무 크게 잃지 않도록 신경써야한다. 그냥 솔직하게 잘 하는 건 잘 한다고 얘기해주고 부족한 점은 같이 보완해보자고 이야기하면 되는 부분인 것 같다. <small>(필자는 동료들의 수습기간 통과 전략을 함께 고민할 때 이런 이야기를 특히 많이 했었던 것 같다)</small></p>\n<p>이렇게 의사결정권을 각 스쿼드의 상황을 제일 잘 알고 있는 엔지니어에게 위임하고 지지함으로써 누군가에게 보고를 하고 허락을 받는 퍼널을 제거하여 의사결정의 속도를 높히고, 실패에 대한 감정을 팀원이 직접 느끼게 하여 성장을 촉진함으로써 퀄리티를 높힐 수 있으며, 장기적으로는 팀원의 자율성과 유능성까지도 챙겨볼 수 있다.</p>\n<p>다만 이런 식의 의사결정체제는 각자가 그냥 하고 싶은대로 해버리는 동상이몽 체제가 되어 대혼란이 발생할 가능성이 높으므로 팀 전체의 명확한 목표 싱크가 반드시 동반되어야 한다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"프론트엔드-챕터라는-조직의-존재-이유-미션에-대해서는-반드시-함께-논의하기\" style=\"position:relative;\">프론트엔드 챕터라는 조직의 존재 이유, 미션에 대해서는 반드시 함께 논의하기<a

대해서 아무런 참여도 할 수 없다면 조직에 대한 소속감이 떨어지는 것이 당연하기 때문에 필자는 프론트엔드 챕터라는 조직의 존재의의를 정의할 때 가급적 많은 팀원들의 의견을 반영하기 위해 노력했다.</p>\n<p>이러한 미션은 주로 OKR의 형태로 정의되었는데, 미션 달성의 여부를 나타내는 지표인 Key Result보다는 미션의 본질인 Objective에 더욱 집중해서 논의하도록 만들었었다.</p>\n<p>“우리는 무엇을 달성하기위해 조직된 팀이며, 우리 팀의 미션은 무엇이고 그 미션을 달성하기 위한 전략은 무엇이다”와 같은 명확한 목표는 말 그대로 프론트엔드 챕터라는 조직이 회사 내에서 어떤 의미를 가지고 존재할 수 있는지에 대한 믿음이라고 할 수 있다.</p>\n<p>이 믿음이 흔들린다면 챕터 내외부에서 모두 “프론트엔드 챕터는 왜 있는건지 모르겠다”와 같은 여론이 형성될 수 있으며, 이 경우 팀원들의 사기, 소속감 하락으로 인해 유능성의 상실과 내재적 동기 훼손으로 이어질 가능성이 높다.</p>\n<p>그리고 이러한 조직의 미션이 중요한 또 한 가지 이유는 바로 조직 운영이라는 것이 마치 유닛을 부대지정하고 어택땅때리면 되는 스타크래프트가 아니라는 것이다. 오히려 조직 운영은 각각의 의사결정역량을 가진 다양한 인간이 모여 하나의 목표를 달성하기 위해 싸워야 하는 오버워치나 배틀그라운드에 가깝다.</p>\n<p>스타크래프트의 유닛들은 명령을 받았을 때 이 명령에 대한 아무런 판단을 하지 않는다. 그저 명령을 내린대로 충실하게 수행할 뿐이다. 비록 메딕도 안 붙은 쌩마린을 럴커 밭에 보내서 전멸이 확정되어있더라도 그 유닛들은 그대로 명령을 따른다. 그렇기 때문에 수 많은 유닛들을 100% 플레이어의 의도대로 편하게 컨트롤할 수 있는 것이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left:

있을 수 밖에 없다.</small>\n</center>\n<p>하지만 오버워치나 배틀그라운드 같은 게임은 오더(Order)가 굉장히 중요하다. 이런 게임은 여러 명의 인간이 하나의 팀을 이뤄 목표를 달성하는 게임이기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>분명 다 같이 화물을 목표지점까지 밀어야 이기는 게임인데, 어떤 팀원은 혼자서 킬먹겠다고 계속 적진으로 달려들다가 죽어나가고, 어떤 팀원은 혼자 화물지키고 있다가 죽고 있으면 게임이 진행이 안 된다. 이 경우 리더는 명확하게 “님들 화물 미는 것에만 집중합시다”, “나머지는 화물에서 시선을 끌고 겐지가 위도우 좀 따주세요”와 같은 명확한 요구사항을 이야기하며 팀원들을 이끌어야 한다. <small>(물론 왠만큼 심해가 아니라면 이런 경우는 많지 않다…고 생각한다)</small></p>\n<p>현실에서의 조직 운영도 이와 비슷하다. 심지어 게임은 게임을 클리어하기 위한 명확한 목표를 자체적으로 부여해주기 때문에 목표에 대한 고민을 할 필요도 없지만, 현실의 조직 운영은 목표부터 함께 싱크해야한다. 이런 과정이 없으면 이름만 같은 팀이지 누구는 오버워치를 하고 있고 누구는 배틀그라운드를 하고 있는 진풍경이 펼쳐지는 것이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a

변화시킬 수 있는 환경을 구축하여 팀원의 자율성을 향상시켜줄 수 있는 요소이기도 하다. 물론 피드백만 주고 받는다고 끝나는게 아니라 피드백을 받은 이후 리더가 직접 감사를 표하거나 실제로 피드백을 수용하는 태도가 함께 동반되어야 한다. <small>(물론 동의가 어려운 피드백은 그 이유에 대해서 자세히 이야기해주면 된다.)</small></p>\n<p>어차피 인간은 완벽할 수 없다. 아무리 뛰어난 인간이라도 여러가지 강점과 약점이 동시에 존재하며, 아무리 일을 오래 했다고 해도 결국 자신의 전문성이 아닌 분야에서는 초보자가 될 수 밖에 없다.</p>\n<p>필자 또한 강점이 있는 반면 명확한 약점도 함께 보유하고 있으며, 오랜 세월 몸 담아온 프론트엔드가 아닌 다른 분야에 대한 지식은 상대적으로 부족하기 때문에 모든 분야에 대한 전문가라고 말할 수는 없다.</p>\n<p>아마 필자가 아닌 다른 사람들 또한 마찬가지일 것이라고 생각한다. 한낱 한 명의 작은 인간이 이 세상 모든 것들을 다 잘할 수는 없는 법이니 말이다.</p>\n<p>물론 직원이 10명 남짓의 규모가 작은 스타트업에서는 뛰어난 리더 한 명이 일종의 소방관처럼 많은 일들을 동시에 처리하기도 하지만, 조직의 규모가 커지면 커질수록 이러한 행위는 점점 더 어려워지며 이러한 위임을 제대로 하지 못 했을 때는 다양한 사이드 이펙트가 발생할 수 있다.</p>\n<p>게다가 이러한 형태의 조직은 리더의 역량에 굉장히 많은 부분이 좌우되는 만큼, 리더가 훌륭한 역량을 보유한 인재가 아니라면 조직 전체의 역량이 함께 무너지게 되는 리스크 또한 존재한다. 즉, 활발한 상호 피드백은 리더의 역량이 부족할 경우 리더를 성장시키거나, 혹은 리더의 부족한 의사결정역량을 헷징(Hedging)할 수 있는 수단도 될 수 있다.</p>\n<p>다만 전통적인 기업에서 리더는 상사와 동일시되는 경우가 많기 때문에 리더 스스로가 피드백에 대한 수용력과 피드백과 자신의 감정을 분리할 수 있는 능력을 보유하고 있지 않다면 활발한 상호 피드백 환경을 만들어내기 어려울 것이다.</p>\n<p>피드백 수용력은 메타인지 역량과도 연결되는데, 사실 메타인지는 “내가 모른다는 것을 안다”라는 고차원적인 개념이기 때문에 스스로 깨우치기는 쉽지 않다고 생각한다. 대부분은 내가 무엇을 모르는지, 무엇을 아는지 조차 명확하지 않은 상황 속에서 스스로 “난 많은 것을 알아”라는 소피스트적 사고를 하게 되기 마련이다.</p>\n<p>필자는 역설적으로 메타인지 역량을 키우기 위한 가장 좋은 방법 또한 팀원들의 피드백이라고 생각한다. 실제로 리더의 역할로 업무를 수행하며 많은 사람들과 이야기를 나눠보면 내가 바라보는 나의 모습과 타인이 바라보는 나의 모습이 꽤나 다른 경우가 많았다.</p>\n<p>필자의 사례를 보자. 왼쪽은 필자가 스스로를 정의한 내용이고, 오른쪽은 동료들이 필자에 대해서 피드백을 주었던 내용이다.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>특징</th>\n<th>필자의 평가</th>\n<th>타인의 평가</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>감정의 기복이 크지 않다.</td>\n<td>감정을 배제한 의사결정을 할 수 있다.</td>\n<td>너무 말투가 차갑다. 배척보다는 포용을 보여줬으면 좋겠다.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>주로 의견을 먼저 내는 편이다.</td>\n<td>자신의 생각을 명확하게 표현한다.</td>\n<td>너무 표현이 강해 반대 의견을 내기가 어렵다.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>사적인 감정을 회사에서 보이지 않는다.</td>\n<td>공과 사가 명확하다.</td>\n<td>인간미가 부족해서 다가가기 어렵다.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>사실 이러한 가치판단에는 일종의 자기 고양 편향 또한 포함되기 때문에 스스로에 대해서는 관대하게, 타인에 대해서는 엄격하게 판단하는 성향이나 개인적인 친밀도로 인한 편향까지 포함될 수 있다. 필자 또한 그런 편향에서 자유로울 수 없는 한낱 인간 중 하나이기 때문에 스스로에 대한 평가가 좋은 방향으로 편향되어있던 것이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 결국 중요한 점은 한 가지이다. 리더는 타인의 신뢰를 얻어야 하는 입장에 놓여있다는 것이다. 그러니 내가 나를 어떻게 생각하는지보다는 타인이 나의 특성을 어떻게 바라보고 있는지에 대해서 확실하게 알아두고 대처해야할 필요가 있다.</p>\n<p>필자가 이야기하고 싶은 것은 편향에 빠지지 말자는 것이 아니다. 비록 필자가 심리학에 대한 전문가는 아니지만 이러한 편향을 완벽히 제거하는 것은 불가능에 가깝다고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>중요한 것은 리더 스스로가 “나는 편향과 오류를 가지고 있다”, “내가 그렇게까지 완벽한 인간이 아니다”라는 것을 인지하고 있는 것이라 생각한다.</p>\n<p>리더도 결국 인간인 이상 당연히 역량이 좋은 부분도 있을 것이고 부족한 부분도 있을 것이며, 모든 것이 완벽할 수는 없다. 하지만 자신의 강점과 약점에 대해서 명확하게 인지하지 못 한 채로 자신의 능력을 벗어난 부분까지 마이크로 매니징하려고 하거나 과도한 의사결정권을 가져가려고 한다면 조직 전체적으로는 오히려 좋지 않은 결과가 발생할 수도 있고, 팀원들의 신뢰를 확보하는 데에도 문제가 발생할 수 있다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:

통해 타인이 나를 어떻게 바라보고 있는지에 대해서 알아내고 그에 알맞는 액션 아이템을 실천함으로써 팀원들에게 비춰지는 나의 모습을 알맞은 방향으로 만들어나가야 하는 것이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 이상을 벗어나 현실을 보다보면 피드백 문화가 제대로 자리잡지 않은 대부분의 조직의 구성원들은 상대방에 대한 자신의 생각을 투명하게 드러내는 것에 대해서 두려워 하는 경우가 많다는 것을 알 수 있다. 특히 개인보다 집단의 가치를 더 중요하게 생각하는 동양 문화에서 리더라는 존재는 명령권자와 동일시 되는 경우가 많기 때문에 이런 고정관념을 없애는 것이 중요하다.</p>\n<p>그래서 리더는 더더욱 자신이 피드백을 원한다는 사실을 팀원들에게 적극적으로 알리고 수용적인 태도를 의도적으로라도 과장해서 보여줘야 할 필요가 있다.</p>\n<p>필자는 2주에 한번씩 프론트엔드 챕터의 모두와 커피챗을 가지면서 그 자리의 마지막에는 항상 피드백을 요청해왔다. 그리고 “저에게 피드백을 주시는 것은 저의 성장을 위한 일이다”, “저도 완벽하지 않으니 피드백을 통해 단점들을 보완하고 싶다”, “ㅇㅇ님이 성장을 원하시는 만큼 저도 성장을 원하는 개발자 중 한 명일 뿐이다”와 같은 명확한 의사 표현을 꾸준히 함으로써 팀원들이 “이 사람 진짜 피드백에 미친 놈인가보다…”라는 생각을 하게 만드려고 노력했다.</p>\n<p>물론 2주에 한번씩 의미있는 피드백을 뽑아내는 것은 쉬운 일이 아니니만큼 대부분의 시간은 “딱히 없어요”의 화려한 향연이었지만, 그래도 계속 이 시간을 유지하다보니 간간히 의미있는 피드백들을 받을 수 있었다. <small>(아침에 일찍 좀 나오라던가…)</small></p>\n<p>또한 그렇게 받은 피드백 중 공감가는 내용이 있다면 그것을 개선하기 위한 액션 아이템을 수립하고 이후 실행 결과를 꼭 공유했다. 물론 결과적으로 개선이 잘 되지 않았던 것들도 많지만, 내가 상대방의 피드백을 무시하지 않았다는 것을 적극적으로 알리기 위한 일종의 수단이었던 것이다.</p>\n<p>사람 성격마다 조금씩 다르긴 하지만, 대한민국과 같은 권위주의적 문화가 강한 곳에서는 팀원이 리더에게 피드백을 준다는 행위가 꽤나 많은 용기를 필요로 한다. 그러니 당연히 피드백을 받은 사람은 팀원이 용기내어 해준 이야기들에 대해서 감사를 표해야하는 것이고, 그 피드백 한 마디 한 마디를 새겨들었다는 표현 또한 해줘야 하는 것이다.</p>\n<p>물론 그 피드백에 대해서 공감이 되지 않았을 수도 있지만, 그래도 팀원이 용기내서 해준 이야기에 대한 감사 표시는 반드시 한 이후에 그 피드백에 대해서 공감가지 않았던 이유가 무엇인지에 대해서 이야기하도록 하자.</p>\n<p>다만 팀원이 피드백을 줬을 때 감정적으로 반응하거나, 말로는 감사하다고 해놓고 피드백 이후 액션아이템이나 액션 실행에 따른 어려움 공유가 전혀 없는 것은 아닌지 경계해야한다. 이런 상황들이 반복되면 팀원은 “어차피 이 사람은 이야기해도 안 바뀌는구나”와 같은 부정적 사고가 강해지게 되고 결국 입을 다물게 된다.</p>\n<p>이런 감정을 느끼는 동료들이 점점 많아지게 되면 조직은 마치 끓고 있는 압력솥처럼 언제 터져도 이상하지 않은 상태가 되어버릴 수도 있다. 리더에 대한 불만은 이미 가득한데, 이에 대해 투명하게 말하는 것을 두려워하거나, 혹은 말해도 바뀌지 않을거란 무력감에 아무도 이야기를 하지 않는 상황이니 말이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 리더는 항상 동료들에게 적극적인 피드백을 구함으로써 동료들이 자신을 어떻게 바라보고 있는지, 내가 부족한 점은 무엇인지, 잘 하고 있는 부분은 무엇인지와 같은 메타인지 역량 향상에 도움이 되는 정보들을 꾸준히 수집해야 한다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"마치며\" style=\"position:relative;\">마치며<a href=\"#%EB%A7%88%EC%B9%98%EB%A9%B0\" aria-label=\"마치며 permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"

인간은 굉장히 일관되지 않은 행동과 사고를 보이고 감정적이며 가지각색의 편향으로 가득한, 너무나도 다양한 성향을 지닌 대상이었던 것이다.</p>\n<p>물론 공감 지능도 높고 사람 자체를 좋아하는 분들 입장에서는 이렇게 다양한 인간 객체가 모인 곳에서 좋은 역량을 발휘하실 수도 있겠지만, 필자는 MBTI도 대문자 T라 딱히 공감 지능이 높은 편도 아니고 사람에게서 에너지를 얻는 타입도 아니라서 좋은 리더십이란 무엇인가, 사람은 무엇으로 움직이는가와 같은 주제에 대해 굉장히 많은 고민과 리서치가 필요했다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;

<small>참고로 필자의 MBTI는 파워 ESTJ인데, 인정하긴 싫지만 은근히 잘 맞는 것 같다.</small>\n</center>\n<p>필자는 사실 관계를 분석하고 논리적 추론으로 연결하는 능력이 좋은 사람이기 때문에 필자에게 가장 잘 맞는 방법은 사람의 심리와 행동원리를 연구한 학문에 대한 지식을 쌓고 주변에 있는 사람들을 관찰하고 분석하여 이 이론과 맞춰보는 것이었다.</p>\n<p>물론 이런 이론이 현실을 100% 설명해줄 수는 없다. 특히 인간 행동원리는 아직도 제대로 밝혀지지 않은 부분이기 때문에 어떤 정답이라고 할 게 없는 것이다. 다만 필자는 주변에서 실제로 발생하는 여러가지 문제들을 관찰하면서 “저 사람은 왜 저렇게 행동할까?”라는 고민과 나름의 분석을 진행할 수 있을 뿐이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 더더욱 어렵다고 느꼈던 것은 아닐까. 물론 세상에 정답이 정해져있는 문제가 얼마나 있겠냐만은 인간처럼 논리적이지 않은 대상을 분석하고 나름의 정의를 내리기란 정말 어려운 것 같다.</p>\n<p>물론 필자는 아직 3년 밖에 되지 않은 병아리 리더이니 이런 고민은 이제 시작 단계이고, 앞으로도 이런 고민을 할 수 있는 날은 많이 남아있으니 서두르지는 않으려고 한다.</p>\n<p>이상으로 인간은 무엇을 위해 일하는가? – 동기 부여의 심리학 포스팅을
