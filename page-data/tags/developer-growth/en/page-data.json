It’s actually a question I’ve been carrying since I first started coding.

After about five years of working as a frontend developer across various organizations, I’d received all sorts of feedback from colleagues. Some generous souls would say things like “Evan is really good at frontend,” and I could never bring myself to confidently reply “Why yes, I am.”</p>\n<p>The reason is simply that I don’t think I’m good at frontend development. And I don’t trust the subjective assessments others assign to me. What I’ve always wanted — and still want — is to be a “good developer” with objective, universally acknowledged value.</p>\n<p>People’s standards differ, of course, but I think “being good” by objective standards means having mastered a body of knowledge. And if you ask whether I’ve mastered frontend development, the answer is obviously “no.” There’s still so much I don’t know, and I spend every day fumbling through new problems and praying to the Google gods.</p>\n<p>So for six years, I’ve been wrestling with: “What is true knowledge?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-was-a-good-developer\" style=\"position:relative;\">I “Was” a Good Developer<a href=\"#i-was-a-good-developer\" aria-label=\"i was a good developer permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I didn’t always have this existential crisis.

Here’s the question I want to pose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are frontend developers and markup engineers the same position?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For context: in the Korean tech industry, “publisher” (퍼블리셔) is a common title for specialists who primarily handle HTML/CSS markup. This distinction between “frontend developer” and “markup engineer” exists in many tech ecosystems under different names — “HTML/CSS developer,” “UI developer,” “web designer who codes,” etc.</p>\n<p>If you work in this industry, you probably have opinions about these roles and how they differ. Let me push the question further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can you distinguish between these two positions?\nIf so, what criteria do you use?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I’m really asking is: what’s the clear, definitive line between the two?</p>\n<p>Both positions build web clients. Yet people draw fairly rigid distinctions between them. So presumably, they know how to tell them apart.</p>\n<p>Generally, a frontend developer is someone who writes client programs that run in web browsers — defining DOM structures with HTML, exchanging data with backend systems using JavaScript, building standalone client applications, and sometimes crafting elegant UI/UX with CSS.</p>\n<p>But laid out like that, it sounds a lot like what a markup engineer does too. In fact, when you look at actual day-to-day work, they’re often identical.</p>\n<p>Some say markup engineers aren’t frontend developers because they don’t know React or Vue. But then what about the people who used to build complex web clients with jQuery? Were they markup engineers? Yet the industry clearly recognized the title “frontend developer” at that time — I was called one myself.</p>\n<p>Others say markup engineers lack the JavaScript or computer science knowledge that frontend developers have. Okay, then let me ask this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much JavaScript does a markup engineer need to know to be called a frontend developer?\nDoes simply acquiring CS knowledge instantly make someone a frontend developer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where answers diverge. Some might say you need to understand closures.

In an era still governed by mythological thinking, oracles carried the weight of law. But Socrates refused to believe it and resolved to find someone wiser than himself.</p>\n<p>From then on, Socrates went around questioning the Sophists — the highly-paid intellectual elite — to gauge how wise they truly were. If we map Socrates’ line of questioning onto our earlier topic, it would go something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What is a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: Someone who has the knowledge needed to build web clients and can actually implement them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then isn’t a markup engineer also a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: No.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What’s the difference between the two?\n<strong>A</strong>: I’d say markup engineers have less computer science knowledge than frontend developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So if a markup engineer studies computer science, do they become a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: I think they’d also need to get hired as a frontend developer to truly be called one.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So the position assigned by a company matters?\n<strong>A</strong>: …I suppose so.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then if a frontend developer at a prestigious tech company takes a markup engineer position at a web agency, are they a frontend developer or a markup engineer?\n<strong>A</strong>: … (contradiction)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was Socrates’ method. He’d ask fundamental questions, and when someone answered, he’d probe the inconsistencies in their response with follow-up questions. After a few rounds, the Sophists would hit a wall — realizing that what they “knew” was actually flawed. They’d become flustered or angry.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 59.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ship\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/0913d/ship.jpg 160w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/cb69c/ship.jpg 320w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg 640w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This state of being shipwrecked on contradictions and impasses is called \"aporia\"</small>\n</center>\n<p>After visiting Sophist after Sophist and finding that none could fully withstand his questioning, Socrates concluded: “These people don’t truly know anything.”</p>\n<p>What about you?

But if Socrates came at me with questions like those, I’d probably answer earnestly for a while before inevitably falling into aporia myself.</p>\n<p>And this method of questioning wasn’t just for the Sophists — Socrates applied it to himself too. After repeating this process over and over, he arrived at a single realization:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only thing I know is that I know nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a statement directed at himself as much as at the Sophists. Neither you nor I truly know anything — but at least I know that I don’t know.</p>\n<p>And Socrates’ conclusion isn’t wrong, either. You have to acknowledge your ignorance before you can pursue deeper truth. Someone who thinks “I already know this” won’t dig any deeper into the subject.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the Sophists didn’t take kindly to Socrates’ attitude. He was eventually charged with “corrupting the youth and undermining Athenian traditions.”</p>\n<p>He could have survived the trial by playing politics and talking his way out, but Socrates refused to bend his convictions. He gave a provocative defense that antagonized the jury, effectively sealing his own fate with a death sentence. <del>(He could have applied for exile to another city-state, but he chose to drink the poison instead — a true hard case…)</del></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"socrates\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/0913d/socrates.jpg 160w,\n/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/cb69c/socrates.jpg 320w,\n/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>In the end, this man chose the hemlock</small>\n</center>\n<p>Even someone as brilliant as Socrates, after all that deliberation, arrived at “I know nothing.” It’s an almost absurdly anticlimactic conclusion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After this long exploration, my question has merely shifted from “What is knowledge?” to “Do we truly know the things we think we know?” — without actually finding an answer.</p>\n<p>I suppose it makes sense that I can’t easily answer a question that even Socrates — counted among the great sages of history — could only resolve with such an empty-sounding conclusion.

It’s not hard to conjure up. I’m a frontend developer, so let’s imagine a situation where I need to build a simple web frontend application.</p>\n<p>First, you need to pick a library or framework that connects your view and model to render the UI. The big names are React, Vue, and Angular. Most people go with React since it has the largest ecosystem, but honestly, you can build whatever you need with any of them.</p>\n<p>Modern web applications demand complex client-side state management, so you’ll also need to choose a state management library. The popular ones are Redux and MobX — pick your flavor. If you chose Vue as your UI framework, just use Vuex for the sake of your mental health.</p>\n<p>If you need to manage complex object state, immutability helpers like ImmutableJS or Immer would be nice to have.</p>\n<p>If you’re using Redux, you’ll also need to pick an async middleware — redux-thunk, redux-saga, and the like. Or how about RxJS, which has been gaining traction lately? It even comes as a Redux middleware via redux-observable.</p>\n<p>For package management, choose between npm or yarn. For unit testing, Mocha or Jest. For your eslint config, pick <code class=\"language-text\">airbnb</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">standard</code> and customize to taste.</p>\n<p>Oh, and come to think of it, using TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript might not be a bad idea — since we’re building this, might as well make it robust. In that case, we need to check whether all those libraries above support TypeScript.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 512px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/36dd4/what.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"what\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/36dd4/what.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/0913d/what.jpg 160w,\n/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/cb69c/what.jpg 320w,\n/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/36dd4/what.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>I thought we were building a \"simple\" application...?</small>\n</center>\n<p>All those tools I just rattled off aren’t me showing off — they’re things frontend developers actually deliberate over every time they start a project at work or on the side. None of them are strictly required, but once you learn them, they boost productivity so much that most frontend developers use some combination of them.</p>\n<p>And to actually use these tools properly, you also need knowledge of JavaScript internals like closures and the event loop, virtual DOM, data binding, MVVM patterns, Flux patterns, functional programming, and more.</p>\n<p>There’s been an explosion of new things in frontend lately, but developers in other specializations face a similarly large body of knowledge. It’s just specialized differently for each discipline.</p>\n<p>The point of this long preamble is really just one thing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Nobody can kindly teach you all of this.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"you-have-to-find-information-yourself\" style=\"position:relative;\">You Have to Find Information Yourself<a href=\"#you-have-to-find-information-yourself\" aria-label=\"you have to find information yourself permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Does anyone exist who could teach you all of that? Personally, I don’t think so.</p>\n<p>If programming were like mathematics — where a formula created 100 years ago is still used 100 years later — then maybe someone could build a systematic curriculum covering everything. But many of the tools I mentioned might not even exist next year. The lifespan of this knowledge is extremely short.</p>\n<p>And it’s hard to say which of these overlapping tools is “better” or “worse.” Go ask a nearby frontend developer “Is React better or Vue?” What do you think they’ll say? Probably that both are good, both are bad, or they’ll just pick their favorite.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, programming is a field where building a specific curriculum is quite difficult. Sure, you can create a curriculum for absolute beginners, but beyond that, curricula become somewhat pointless.</p>\n<p>Imagine spending three months at a bootcamp diligently learning Vue, only to join a company that uses React. You can’t exactly ask the company for time off to go learn React for another three months.</p>\n<p>In the end, developers have no choice but to get comfortable finding and learning information on their own, tailored to their organization’s needs and the technologies they want to explore. That’s why “just Google it” is the answer to so many developer questions.</p>\n<p>But actively learning by finding information on Google and Stack Overflow requires the ability to choose effective search keywords and the discernment to distinguish good information from bad — which makes it harder than it sounds. <del>(You also need decent English.)</del> And nobody can teach you this; you have to practice and figure it out yourself.</p>\n<p>But since I can’t just tell someone to “go Google things” when they don’t even know what to search for or what to study, let me share a very simple method I use frequently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-keywords-are-connected\" style=\"position:relative;\">All Keywords Are Connected<a href=\"#all-keywords-are-connected\" aria-label=\"all keywords are connected permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>When we study, we typically “memorize.” Memorization-based learning allows us to quickly absorb narrow pieces of information, making it a pretty good fit for developers who are constantly chasing new trends.</p>\n<p>You know — memorizing the four characteristics of pure functions, or the features and trade-offs of TCP vs. UDP. Or when a new library or framework comes out, skimming the docs and coding along is also a form of memorization.</p>\n<p>But while memorization is fast, it has a downside: keyword acquisition is fragmented. By “fragmented,” I mean that learning one keyword doesn’t naturally lead you to the next.

React’s <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> is a hook used to store and remember state in functional components.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-jsx line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">Foo</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> setCount<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">useState</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n      </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n      </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">onClick</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">setCount</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>count<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">+</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n    </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Knowing that <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> lets you manage state in functional components is perfectly sufficient for writing code and building applications. If you’re learning under time pressure, you can stop here and start coding. But if knowing that <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> exists isn’t enough to satisfy you, this is where you should throw out a new question.</p>\n<p>When I first encountered React’s functional components and learned about this hook, I had this very basic curiosity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does the <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> hook store state?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This isn’t some profound question. It’s just taking one small step of curiosity beyond the simple memorization of ”<code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> lets you store state in functional components.”</p>\n<p>Someone with deep JavaScript knowledge might have had a more advanced question right away, but at the time, I had zero intuition about how the hook worked internally.</p>\n<p>Anyway — you’ve asked yourself a question, so now you need to find the answer. There’s no teacher beside you, so let’s just search this question on Google as-is.</p>\n<p>My search query: “how does useState work.” Search keywords aren’t a paid resource — just type whatever comes to mind. There’s no special skill required for Googling.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/3d405/googled.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 105.62500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"googled\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/6af66/googled.png\" srcset=\"/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/69538/googled.png 160w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/72799/googled.png 320w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/6af66/googled.png 640w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/d9199/googled.png 960w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/21b4d/googled.png 1280w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/3d405/googled.png 1348w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The Google gods know all things</small>\n</center>\n<p>Searching this keyword, I can already see detailed posts where others have explained React hooks. If searching in your native language doesn’t yield results, try an English query like “principle of useState” — you’ll almost always find what you need. The gap in available information between searching in English versus other languages is enormous, so it’s worth building the habit of searching in English.</p>\n<p>React’s <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> hook actually uses JavaScript closures to store state within a function. With a bit of searching, you’ll discover the keyword “closure.”</p>\n<p>Once you’ve found this new keyword, if you already know what closures are, you might try implementing <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> from scratch as a learning exercise. If not, search for “JavaScript closures” and study up. While studying closures, you’ll probably find another question to ask, which will lead you to yet another keyword deeper down.</p>\n<p>Some readers might think, “I can barely keep up with learning and using things as-is — when am I supposed to understand the underlying principles?” But there’s an important distinction between “the ability to understand a keyword” and “the ability to find a keyword.”</p>\n<p>The ability to understand a keyword quickly can’t be developed in a short time with a few tips. It requires a baseline level of domain knowledge.</p>\n<p>But “the ability to find keywords” is different. It doesn’t require any particular level of knowledge — just fingers that can type a search query into Google. And if you discover a new keyword that feels too difficult to understand right now, you don’t have to learn it immediately.</p>\n<p>The smallest value of acquiring a keyword is knowing that “something like this exists in the world.” If you know the keyword exists, you can come back to it later when your knowledge has deepened. Then you study it, ask more questions, discover the next keyword, and repeat. <del>(If you work as a developer, the day will come when you need to learn that keyword.)</del></p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I’ll admit the title “Question Driven Thinking” sounds grandiose, but as I mentioned, learning through questions isn’t something I invented — it’s a well-known learning method.</p>\n<p>This approach of gradually finding answers through questions has been used since ancient Greece.
