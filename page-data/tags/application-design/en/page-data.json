The key point here is “expressing something that’s actually complex in a simple way.”</p>\n<p>One difference between artistic and industrial abstraction: in art, abstraction <em>removes</em> the complex parts, while in industry, abstraction <em>hides</em> them.</p>\n<p>In other words, by hiding concrete, complex implementation behind a simple form, you enable users of your module, component, or product to utilize its functionality without needing to understand the underlying principles.</p>\n<p>Take the computers we use in daily life. Very few people understand the principles down to the semiconductor level, and even elementary school students who don’t know what a CPU is can use a computer. We can abstract “computer” as “a device you operate with a keyboard and mouse to see results on a monitor or speaker” — and that’s sufficient for use. There’s no need or reason to understand every detail of how a computer works.</p>\n<p>A person using Photoshop to edit photos just needs to focus on how to use Photoshop. They don’t need to know how the program works internally or how the OS allocates resources to its process.</p>\n<p>If a Photoshop user had to worry about all of that, wouldn’t “editing a photo in Photoshop” become prohibitively difficult and complex?</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/164a4e620bcf57d8857f4541b3fbe14b/6a068/photoshop.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAY6INFwoT//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEDEiFB/9oACAEBAAEFAoSWrUVi6VR4f//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwERf//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABkQAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEQAhMf/aAAgBAQAGPwI3uE3ccX//xAAbEAADAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEAMUFRsf/aAAgBAQABPyEutTEs8PsOdxqfMGN514Ga+zv/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEIfP/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQ/9oACAEDAQE/EFDc/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARARIf/aAAgBAgEBPxBG8j//xAAeEAEAAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEAQdExUWFxkf/aAAgBAQABPxA3K1IRuaxL352LEa84x1I9eMVp0VYwXaBaWLmvmSubP//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"photoshop\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/164a4e620bcf57d8857f4541b3fbe14b/c08c5/photoshop.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/164a4e620bcf57d8857f4541b3fbe14b/0913d/photoshop.jpg 160w,\n/static/164a4e620bcf57d8857f4541b3fbe14b/cb69c/photoshop.jpg 320w,\n/static/164a4e620bcf57d8857f4541b3fbe14b/c08c5/photoshop.jpg 640w,\n/static/164a4e620bcf57d8857f4541b3fbe14b/6a068/photoshop.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    If editing photos in Photoshop required understanding all the principles of image processing,<br>\n    the task would become far too difficult for a single person's capacity.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>The fundamental concept of abstraction is already at work in cars, smartphones, urban infrastructure, administrative systems, and more. Many things we take for granted are the result of complex logic and infrastructure being abstracted away.</p>\n<p>Thanks to abstraction, we can leverage the systems of complex modern society without needing encyclopedic knowledge across every field.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Turn the faucet and clean water comes out → The city’s water supply system is abstracted</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the municipal office and you can register your residence → The government’s administrative system is divided and abstracted</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Press the accelerator and the car moves forward → The ECU and engine logic handling intake/compression/combustion/exhaust is abstracted</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The world we live in today is built on layers of abstract concepts. Thanks to this concept of expressing complex things simply, people can focus only on what they’re responsible for, enabling division of labor and the creation of things more complex than ever before.</p>\n<p>The semiconductor manufacturer focuses only on semiconductors. The computer assembler focuses on computers. The Photoshop developer focuses on image processing and programming. The artist focuses on using Photoshop. Because specialists in each field come together, they can build things more vast and complex than any individual could. If one person had to understand all of it to produce a product, even a lifetime of knowledge-building wouldn’t be enough to produce complex products at high quality.</p>\n<p>These benefits of abstraction apply equally to our experience of programming. The software we build is, like products in other industries, an assembly of many small modules contributed by countless people around the world.</p>\n<p>Frontend developers like me mostly use libraries and frameworks like React or Vue to build web applications. Combining these small programs to create complex applications is nothing unusual.</p>\n<p>Honestly, even without knowing the detailed inner workings of a JavaScript engine, knowing the general syntax of JavaScript and how to use the React library is enough to build applications.</p>\n<p>In the past, developers routinely configured Webpack themselves to bundle applications. Now, CLIs like CRA or frameworks like Next.js generate Webpack configurations automatically — and even hide them behind abstractions. Some developers who started recently have never touched Webpack directly. <em>(In practice, you can build typical applications these days without any Webpack knowledge.)</em></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/6fa81/webpack.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 87.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"webpack\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/6af66/webpack.png\" srcset=\"/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/69538/webpack.png 160w,\n/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/72799/webpack.png 320w,\n/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/6af66/webpack.png 640w,\n/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/d9199/webpack.png 960w,\n/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/21b4d/webpack.png 1280w,\n/static/eefb5d1a1b23c4fc1c4b4275d203c295/6fa81/webpack.png 1856w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    Search \"webpack eject\" on Google and you'll see<br>\n    just how many people try to avoid breaking the abstraction and touching Webpack directly.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>Thanks to these abstractions, today’s frontend developers are freed from complex concepts like manually syncing state with UI rendering or bundling projects themselves, allowing them to focus on higher-level concerns.

But this concept is neither new nor strange.</p>\n<p>Earlier, I explained that abstraction hides complex things to make them appear simple, and that thanks to this, we can live in modern society without knowing all the knowledge that constitutes it.</p>\n<p>Application design is the same. Instead of asking “what are the commonalities of these concrete implementations and how do I abstract them?”, you should ask “which parts of the concrete implementation should I package as separate components, and how should I let developers assemble these components so they can comfortably use my code without knowing more context than necessary?”</p>\n<p>The result may be similar — common aspects of concrete concepts end up being abstracted — but the direction of thinking is the exact opposite of extracting commonalities.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we need to build an iPhone. Approaching it by extracting commonalities from objects, the thinking flow would go something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All iPhone models have a way to go home (commonality)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>iPhones can be divided into those with and without a home button (difference)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then maybe I add a parameter to show or hide the home button? (implementing the difference)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"tsx\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-tsx line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-tsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">interface</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Props</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  showHomeButton<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">boolean</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> showHomeButton <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Props<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>isHomeScreen<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> setHomeScreen<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">useState</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">moveHome</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">setHomeScreen</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>showHomeButton <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">HomeButton</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">onClick</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>moveHome<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">HomeGesture</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">onSwipeUp</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>moveHome<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<center>\n  <small>\n    I wrote this using React's function declaration pattern, which I'm more familiar with.<br />\n    The concept of composing abstract things to build concrete things remains the same regardless.\n  </small>\n  <br />\n  <br />\n</center>\n<p>Something like this, roughly.

agree. The “go home” feature is an abstract capability that has little to do with the “home button” itself. The home button — the entity that triggers the go-home event — is highly likely to change depending on the phone’s design.</p>\n<p>But as I mentioned, developers unfamiliar with this approach can easily get trapped by their existing knowledge of iPhone features or the current requirements, failing to recognize that the home button is highly change-prone. They might conflate the stable “go home” function with the volatile “home button” as a single concept, producing a tightly coupled design.</p>\n<p>Those who immediately thought “this should be injected from outside” probably developed that insight through past painful experiences, building an intuition for which parts change frequently. In a word: experience.</p>\n<p>But beginners lacking this insight will formulaically extract commonalities from concrete things to abstract, then ad-hoc their way through design extensions as the business evolves. It’s too easy to fall into this pattern.</p>\n<p>Concepts like IoC and DI are things you naturally learn through study after suffering through these mistakes a few times — very few people start development with these concepts already in hand.</p>\n<p>That’s why I recommend approaching abstraction not by extracting commonalities from concrete things, but by first thinking about what small components your concept is made of, then composing those components to build the concrete concept.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An iPhone is composed of a microphone, speaker, display, home button, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How should each component be assembled?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Speakers and microphones probably don’t change position much across different smartphones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Home buttons differ by smartphone, right? Some don’t even have one nowadays. So how should this be assembled?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This bottom-up thinking naturally makes it easier to create designs that can cover not just the concept of “iPhone” but even the broader concept of “smartphone.”</p>\n<p>Since concrete concepts tend to reflect only the current business situation, extracting commonalities from them makes it hard to account for future changes. But when you think in terms of composing abstract concepts to build concrete ones, you naturally — almost without conscious effort — end up with designs where abstract components can be swapped in and out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"things-worth-considering-for-good-abstraction\" style=\"position:relative;\">Things Worth Considering for Good Abstraction<a href=\"#things-worth-considering-for-good-abstraction\" aria-label=\"things worth considering for good abstraction permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Having covered the macro aspects — what abstraction is and how to approach it — let me now discuss some actionable considerations for when you actually perform abstraction.</p>\n<p>I suggested using bottom-up thinking to consider what abstracted components you need to achieve concrete requirements. When abstracting this way, new questions arise: “what granularity should each component be?” and “how should I express each component’s functionality?”</p>\n<p>You could separate concerns so each component handles a single small responsibility, but splitting too finely can create over-abstraction that makes it hard to grasp context. You might also create components whose functionality is poorly expressed, making them difficult to compose with others.</p>\n<p>So in this section, I’ll share a few considerations I keep in mind when abstracting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dont-force-excessive-context-on-developers\" style=\"position:relative;\">Don’t Force Excessive Context on Developers<a href=\"#dont-force-excessive-context-on-developers\" aria-label=\"dont force excessive context on developers permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>When people talk about the benefits of abstraction, they usually mention reusability. But as I’ve said repeatedly, the greatest benefit of abstraction is making complex things appear simple.</p>\n<p>This benefit can be found in classes, functions, and components alike. Here’s a rough example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prepend “I am ” to each value in the array.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ts\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-ts line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> arr <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'Evan'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Daniel'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Martin'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> newArr <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  newArr<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\">I am </span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span>arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token builtin\">console</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>newArr<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ['I am Evan', 'I am Daniel', 'I am Martin'];</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Few people write imperative code like this nowadays, but I’ve exaggerated for illustration.

Because all a developer needs to know is whether the code properly prepends “I am” to each array value. They don’t need to know anything about indices or <code class=\"language-text\">for</code> loops.</p>\n<p>What if we abstract this operation at various levels?</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ts\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-ts line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Abstract only the array iteration and new array creation</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> newArray <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>v <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\">I am </span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span>v<span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Also abstract the string concatenation with template strings</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> newArray <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>v <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">addPrefix</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>v<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'I am'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Also abstract the fact that map is used</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> newArray <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">addPrefixToItems</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'I am'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Abstract even the \"I am\" string concatenation</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> newArray <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">addIamToItems</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>These code samples show progressively higher levels of abstraction from top to bottom.</p>\n<p>The top code abstracts away the <code class=\"language-text\">for</code> loop and new array creation, so the developer no longer needs the context of manually initializing and managing an <code class=\"language-text\">i</code> variable or declaring a new array. They just need to know how <code class=\"language-text\">Array.prototype.map</code> works — that it iterates an array and creates a new array from transformed elements. Code abstracted this way focuses more on the developer’s intended behavior than on the step-by-step instructions for the computer, which is why it’s also called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">declarative programming</a>. <em>(Focusing on what to do rather than how to do it.)</em></p>\n<p>Let’s look at a more everyday example.

But even a component this small has an enormous amount abstracted away when you examine each operation.</p>\n<p>If you had to read and understand all this code — or write it from scratch — to create this one component, it would no longer be a “simple” component. Abstraction makes it <em>look</em> simple; it’s actually not simple at all. <em>(Just implementing React in vanilla JS is already a significant undertaking…)</em></p>\n<p>But because all those behaviors described in the comments are abstracted into libraries like <code class=\"language-text\">emotion</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">date-fns</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">react</code>, we can ignore these complex operations and focus solely on “rendering the current time.”</p>\n<p>To emphasize once more: the value of industrial abstraction is making complex things appear simple, so that individual people can focus on their area of expertise and collaborate to build things more sophisticated and complex. This essential value of abstraction is exactly what we experience in our daily programming lives.</p>\n<p>When people discuss code readability, they often talk about the number of lines. But this is less about having many lines and more about “the amount of code you need to read and analyze to understand a module’s behavior.”</p>\n<p>Simply imagine what it would be like if all the contents of the <code class=\"language-text\">emotion</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">date-fns</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">react</code> libraries were declared in the same module as the <code class=\"language-text\">Foo</code> component.</p>\n<p>Opening that module with no prior knowledge, you’d struggle to figure out where to start reading, what you can safely ignore, and where in all that code a bug might be. The context forced upon the developer would be excessive.</p>\n<p>The same logic explains why frequently used modules in an organization are published as separate packages to a registry rather than just separated within the application. Both approaches separate the code from business logic, but a package blocks or discourages developers from peeking at the source code, thereby limiting their exposure to the separated module’s context. <em>(Of course, dependency management and cross-application reusability are also benefits of internal libraries.)</em></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ts\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-ts line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Clearly looks like following the reference would lead to @quotalab/utils.d.ts</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// So people rarely try to peek at the source</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> uniq <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@quotalab/utils'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// This path makes it feel like you could immediately see the source</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// When something seems off, people jump right to the source -> context is exposed</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> uniq <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'utils/array'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<center>\n  <small>\n    If you make it inconvenient for developers to peek at source code, the risk of exposing them to unnecessary context also decreases.\n  </small>\n  <br />\n  <br />\n</center>\n<p>Ultimately, the fundamental reason we abstract is to create context scopes — so that other developers reading our code (or our future selves) aren’t exposed to excessive context when trying to understand behavior.

Users can use any <code class=\"language-text\">button</code> property they want, giving them high development freedom.</p>\n<p>But because the component provides so many properties, users are continuously exposed to contexts that may not align with their purpose. I often describe this as “the component forcing decisions on the developer.”</p>\n<p>From the creator’s perspective, you can’t predict every way users might use your module, which increases the risk of bugs or use cases that deviate from the design intent.</p>\n<p>In other words, by controlling the module’s input range, the developer who creates the abstracted module can also somewhat control how users interact with it. So input design directly impacts the DX of developers using the module.</p>\n<p>This type of consideration mainly arises when building internal libraries that many developers share. Design systems add even more complexity because you need to incorporate the designer’s intent when designing interfaces. <em>(The more the code properties align with those defined in Figma or Framer, the lower the communication cost between developers and designers.)</em></p>\n<p>There’s no correct answer for whether to open up or restrict a module’s inputs. It depends on the users’ expertise, the module’s purpose, and whether it targets a general audience (like open source) or a limited group (like an internal library).</p>\n<p>The concept of shaping user experience by controlling the scope of provided functionality isn’t limited to code — it’s everywhere in daily life.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/12609/synth2.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 49.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"synth2\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/c08c5/synth2.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/0913d/synth2.jpg 160w,\n/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/cb69c/synth2.jpg 320w,\n/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/c08c5/synth2.jpg 640w,\n/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/6a068/synth2.jpg 960w,\n/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/eea4a/synth2.jpg 1280w,\n/static/6754c9f5811dfe2b0eeedef280d18fc0/12609/synth2.jpg 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 498px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5a9317f4f11dd17948f8a328924b4d7d/4e442/piano.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"piano\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/5a9317f4f11dd17948f8a328924b4d7d/4e442/piano.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/5a9317f4f11dd17948f8a328924b4d7d/0913d/piano.jpg 160w,\n/static/5a9317f4f11dd17948f8a328924b4d7d/cb69c/piano.jpg 320w,\n/static/5a9317f4f11dd17948f8a328924b4d7d/4e442/piano.jpg 498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>People with professional audio knowledge can leverage a synthesizer's vast features in the right contexts,<br>but without that knowledge, a digital piano with limited features may be more appropriate for the purpose.\n  <small>\n</small></small></center>\n<p>A synthesizer lets you directly manipulate audio waveforms to create any sound you want, offering infinite freedom.

But if you’re ever in a position to build an abstracted module that other developers will use, it’s well worth thinking about.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\">Closing thoughts<a href=\"#closing-thoughts\" aria-label=\"closing thoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Every developer on Earth today exists in a close collaborative relationship with other developers. Some may work alone as freelancers or in early-stage startups, but ultimately they can’t avoid using tools that others conceived and developed. And since you’re not taking your code to the grave, the day will inevitably come when another developer inherits it.</p>\n<p>Since the moment when someone else must read and understand the code you wrote today is unavoidable, we have no choice but to put effort into writing code that humans can understand. Even if you truly are the only person who will ever touch it — there’s no guarantee your future self will remember how every piece works.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, abstraction in programming is the process of making things with complex underlying principles — or things easily understood by computers but hard for humans, easier for humans to understand. The methods and know-how for good abstraction may vary from person to person, but the fundamental essence of abstraction doesn’t change.</p>\n<p>Personally, I don’t think the specific methods or know-how of abstraction are that important. As I mentioned, patterns and methods for creating designs open to change are already abundant on the internet, and many concepts are already cleanly organized. Reading them and using them a few times should be enough to pick them up.</p>\n<p>But without understanding the fundamental value that the gift of abstraction brings us, it becomes difficult to even judge whether the information you’ve studied is truly useful or not.</p>\n<p>Developers frequently invoke “No Silver Bullet” — the idea that no universal solution exists for all problems. As this phrase implies, not all information we encounter brings only benefits; sometimes a technical decision we make costs us something in return.</p>\n<p>In such circumstances, developers must always coolly weigh the benefits of their decisions against the losses, and what helps with these decisions is an understanding of the fundamental value that the technology provides.</p>\n<p>Of course, what I’ve written in this post isn’t the definitive answer. These are simply the thoughts I’ve developed while working as a developer, and I imagine tens of millions of developers worldwide each have their own definitions arrived at through their own deliberation.</p>\n<p>I hope these reflections contribute even a little to the definition of abstraction you’ve arrived at, or will arrive at in the future.
