But rather than rewards materializing on their own just because you’re good at your job, it’s more like having the capability to seize good opportunities when they come. Being good at your job and being good at making money are slightly different things.</p>\n<p>There are senior developers out there who’ve built solid skills through consistent effort yet receive less compensation than entry-level developers because nobody knows about them. Conversely, there are developers whose programming skills are unremarkable but who command high compensation through personal branding.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s true that better programming skills generally correlate with better compensation. But no matter how skilled you are, if you just sit there quietly, chances are nobody will notice. And honestly, unless you’re a truly top 1% standout, most developers at a similar level of experience are roughly comparable in programming skills.</p>\n<p>The beautiful story of “hard work proportionally rewarded” can be motivating, but if you look closely at reality, you’ll find that things don’t work that way more often than not.</p>\n<p>That’s why in this post, rather than talking about growth, I want to talk about something more practical — the market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"develop-a-basic-understanding-of-the-market-game\" style=\"position:relative;\">Develop a Basic Understanding of the Market Game<a href=\"#develop-a-basic-understanding-of-the-market-game\" aria-label=\"develop a basic understanding of the market game permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>South Korea, where we live, is a capitalist country. Simply put, capitalism is an economic system where market participants exchange their respective values within the market.</p>\n<p>In other words, the labor market where working professionals like us seek jobs fundamentally operates on the principle of exchanging the worker’s labor — a commodity — for the company’s financial compensation.</p>\n<p>It’s a remarkably simple and clear concept, yet we often forget it in our daily lives. The very first thing we need to do to survive in the ruthless game of the market is to change how we view the labor market itself.</p>\n<p>The market is a game where participants make decisions to maximize their own gains. There are many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">game theories</a> that model and study the decisions made in markets, but I think the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prisoner’s Dilemma</a> most closely resembles reality.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\"></th>\n<th align=\"center\">Other confesses</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Other stays silent</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><strong>I confess</strong></td>\n<td align=\"center\">Both get 3 years</td>\n<td align=\"center\">I go free, other gets 10 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><strong>I stay silent</strong></td>\n<td align=\"center\">I get 10 years, other goes free</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Both get 1 year</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The defining feature of the Prisoner’s Dilemma is that even when each individual makes the best choice for themselves, the collective outcome may not be optimal. If both stay silent, both get just 1 year. But if I stay silent while the other confesses, I alone face 10 years — that risk exists.</p>\n<p>So both sides end up choosing to confess — the option that benefits them regardless of what the other does — and they serve 3 years together.</p>\n<p>This is similar to how eliminating nuclear weapons would clearly benefit the entire planet, yet no country can easily make that choice. Most interactions in the market follow the same pattern — participants tend to act in their own interest rather than for the collective good.</p>\n<p>Now let’s set aside the heavy theory and talk about something every working professional cares about — salary — to start shifting our perspective on the market.</p>\n<h3 id=\"there-are-no-absolute-winners-and-losers-in-the-market\" style=\"position:relative;\">There Are No Absolute Winners and Losers in the Market<a href=\"#there-are-no-absolute-winners-and-losers-in-the-market\" aria-label=\"there are no absolute winners and losers in the market permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Most working professionals have thought at least once about wanting a higher salary. A higher salary doesn’t automatically make you wealthy, but it does noticeably improve your quality of life.</p>\n<p>Many people vaguely think of salary as something that increases with tenure or through job changes, but in reality, salaries are determined by the market’s cold evaluation.</p>\n<p>To increase your salary, you first need to clearly recognize and accept that it doesn’t go up simply because you’ve worked longer — it’s the price the market assigns to your skills and labor. We’re engaged in a transaction where we sell our skills and labor, and in return, the buyer — the company — provides us with the value we call salary.</p>\n<p>Every interaction in a capitalist market economy starts from the transaction of exchanging value for value. The higher the perceived value of the skills and labor you provide as a seller, the more the buyer — the company — will pay.</p>\n<p>I think demanding a higher salary without any improvement in your abilities is no different from trying to charge consumers more for a product with zero improvements, just to pad your margins. <small>(Think about how consumers react when chicken prices go up with no justification.)</small></p>\n<p>The most fundamental principle for increasing your salary in the market is: <strong>raise the value of what you’re selling — your skills and labor — before making a deal.</strong></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/7e75357bf1d72f21d3f9cf4fcf4753a2/38a65/market.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.24999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"market\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/7e75357bf1d72f21d3f9cf4fcf4753a2/6af66/market.png\" srcset=\"/static/7e75357bf1d72f21d3f9cf4fcf4753a2/69538/market.png 160w,\n/static/7e75357bf1d72f21d3f9cf4fcf4753a2/72799/market.png 320w,\n/static/7e75357bf1d72f21d3f9cf4fcf4753a2/6af66/market.png 640w,\n/static/7e75357bf1d72f21d3f9cf4fcf4753a2/d9199/market.png 960w,\n/static/7e75357bf1d72f21d3f9cf4fcf4753a2/38a65/market.png 1075w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>A labor market transaction isn't fundamentally different from buying and selling a coffee at a café.</small>\n</center>\n<p>Of course, in the labor market, there’s often an information asymmetry between us (the sellers) and the companies (the buyers). If you go in unprepared, you’ll likely find yourself in a disadvantaged position, providing quality labor below market rate.</p>\n<p>But since this is fundamentally still a market transaction, these positions can always be reversed depending on factors like information, the relative value of your product, supply and demand, negotiation skills, and market conditions.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the belief that companies are always in a position of power and workers are always at a disadvantage, there are workers who hold the upper hand in negotiations thanks to their quality labor and information advantage. It just appears as though workers are always disadvantaged because such workers make up a very small proportion.</p>\n<p>When someone commands a high salary, it means the value of their labor is high, demand is strong, and supply falls short. Workers at this level are desired by companies of all sizes, and companies end up competing with each other for them.</p>\n<p>Workers who can provide high-quality labor often hold a stronger position than companies in the market. Instead of submitting resumes and going through interviews, they receive outreach from companies and gather information through coffee chats and recruiting dinners before choosing where to go. There are no absolute winners and losers in the labor market.</p>\n<p>These are all obvious facts when you think of them as regular market transactions, but the unique characteristics of the labor market — combined with the reality that most workers negotiate from a weaker position — cause us to view this market through a slightly different lens.</p>\n<p>The first perspective shift for surviving the market is to abandon the self-deprecating mindset and recognize that you can become a player capable of transacting on equal terms with companies — putting yourself in a state where you can engage in productive strategizing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"all-market-participants-are-selfish\" style=\"position:relative;\">All Market Participants Are Selfish<a href=\"#all-market-participants-are-selfish\" aria-label=\"all market participants are selfish permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Occasionally, the news makes it seem like companies and workers are enemies. Unions going on strike because companies won’t pay fair wages, or workers being laid off and threatened in their livelihoods due to poor corporate governance — these aren’t rare occurrences.</p>\n<p>Since we’re usually on the worker’s side, it’s natural to empathize more with workers than with companies. But viewed coldly, these situations are simply a series of cooperation and betrayal among game participants fighting for their own interests.</p>\n<p>The very concept of a labor union is a group that bands together to negotiate on equal footing with companies and secure workers’ interests. Naturally, most decisions are made in favor of workers, not companies. Conversely, companies will make decisions that favor the company over workers.</p>\n<p>As I said at the beginning, the market is fundamentally a game where all participants act selfishly to maximize their gains within the bounds of the law. To survive in the market, you need logical judgment and a neutral perspective that can coldly analyze situations and make optimal decisions — rather than emotional judgments about good versus evil.</p>\n<p>As sellers, we want to sell our abilities at a high price; as buyers, companies want to buy at the lowest price possible. This, too, is perfectly natural when you think of it as a regular market transaction. There’s no reason to call a worker demanding high pay greedy, and no reason to call a company offering low pay evil.</p>\n<center>\n  <div style=\"max-width: 300px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/28f028c4465567d2f13fa16ff2cc7326/8e1fc/carrot.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 103.75000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"carrot\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/28f028c4465567d2f13fa16ff2cc7326/c08c5/carrot.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/28f028c4465567d2f13fa16ff2cc7326/0913d/carrot.jpg 160w,\n/static/28f028c4465567d2f13fa16ff2cc7326/cb69c/carrot.jpg 320w,\n/static/28f028c4465567d2f13fa16ff2cc7326/c08c5/carrot.jpg 640w,\n/static/28f028c4465567d2f13fa16ff2cc7326/8e1fc/carrot.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <small>If either side offers a ridiculous price, the transaction simply doesn't happen</small>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>There are certainly bad actors — companies that exploit information asymmetry to lowball quality talent, or pile on work beyond what was originally agreed. These unfair practices exist.</p>\n<p>But from the other side, there are workers who engage in quiet quitting despite receiving high salaries, demand excessive perks not in the original agreement, or show a completely different attitude after joining compared to the passion they displayed during interviews. Unfair behavior goes both ways.</p>\n<p>Because evaluations of the other party are relative, there are no absolute heroes or villains.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, both companies and workers are simply equal game participants acting selfishly in their own interests. If a worker’s default position in the market is that of the underdog, we should acknowledge it and come up with strategies to flip that position.</p>\n<p>For a successful transaction in the market, you can’t just think about your own position — you need to understand the other party’s position and psychology and propose appropriate terms. Of course, you don’t have to keep cooperating after getting burned once — think of it as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tit-for-tat</a> strategy.</p>\n<p>Tit-for-tat starts with cooperation but reciprocates: if the other side betrays you, you respond in kind; if they cooperate, you cooperate back. Deals between workers and companies mainly happen during compensation negotiations. You might cooperate during the initial negotiation, but if subsequent negotiations don’t go your way, there’s no reason to stay — consider looking at opportunities elsewhere.</p>\n<p>When negotiations fall through, some people take an emotional approach: “I devoted so much to this company, how could they do this to me?” But getting emotional with a buyer who won’t pay your asking price won’t make them hand over what you want for free.</p>\n<p>Imagine telling a café owner who wants to charge <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>80</mn><mi>f</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>o</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\"</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><msup><mi>t</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><msup><mi>I</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup><mi>m</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">.</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\"</mi><mi>I</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>w</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>y</mi><mtext>—</mtext><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\"</mi><mi>H</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>x</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">?</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">!</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\"</mi><mtext>—</mtext><mi>o</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>u</mi><mtext>—</mtext><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\"</mi><mi>M</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">.</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">.</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">.</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\"</mi><mtext>—</mtext><mi>y</mi><mi>o</mi><msup><mi>u</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">.</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>e</mi><msup><mi>y</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup><mi>d</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>j</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">80 for an americano, \"That's too expensive, I'm not buying.\" If the owner gets angry — \"How is this expensive?!\" — or tries to guilt you — \"My family is going through hard times...\" — you're still not buying that coffee.

Everyone’s capabilities and circumstances are so different that while there may be some useful techniques, there’s no silver bullet strategy that guarantees “do this and your salary goes up.”</p>\n<p>All I can do is offer a small nudge to help you start thinking about these strategies by shifting how you view the labor market and its basic concepts.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, we’re sellers — or producers — in the labor market, needing to sell our abilities to companies. In other words, we should think of our abilities as a product and consider what information buyers need to make a purchase decision.</p>\n<p>Some might object to treating people as products and putting price tags on them. But we’re already providing labor to companies and receiving a salary in return, aren’t we? That’s the price tag on us. More precisely, it’s the <strong>price assigned to the abilities a person possesses</strong>, not the person themselves. <small>(That’s why we use the term “talent acquisition” — hiring the talent within a person, not purchasing the person.)</small></p>\n<p>Of course, factors like minimum wage laws exist to guarantee basic survival, but fundamentally, it’s just a price formed by supply and demand for a product.</p>\n<p>The act of companies purchasing our abilities in the labor market isn’t much different from us buying an expensive product on an e-commerce platform. For example, imagine you need to buy a robot vacuum.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/d9ed5/coupang.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 62.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"coupang\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/6af66/coupang.png\" srcset=\"/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/69538/coupang.png 160w,\n/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/72799/coupang.png 320w,\n/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/6af66/coupang.png 640w,\n/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/d9199/coupang.png 960w,\n/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/21b4d/coupang.png 1280w,\n/static/3e1d7d064e044b9f2a9991365283f479/d9ed5/coupang.png 2880w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Robot vacuums are surprisingly expensive...</small>\n</center>\n<p>When buying products online, you can’t try them out beforehand. And while you might impulse-buy something cheap, when it comes to an expensive product like a robot vacuum, you’ll be more careful to avoid wasting your hard-earned money.</p>\n<p>So we typically read the product detail page carefully, check reviews and ratings from other buyers, maybe even look at video reviews on YouTube, and only when we think “this seems like a reasonable purchase” do we pull the trigger. <small><del>(Some people just buy on impulse, sure…)</del></small></p>\n<p>The customers buying our abilities are the same way. Buyers in the labor market can’t directly experience our abilities before purchasing. They make their buying decisions based on a simple product brochure (resume), roughly 2 hours of door-to-door sales (interviews), and maybe reviews from previous customers (reference checks).</p>\n<p>At this stage, it’s not the product’s actual specs but the information presenting the product and others’ reviews that have the biggest influence on the purchase decision.</p>\n<p>On top of that, human ability is an extremely expensive product — costing tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year — and once purchased, it’s hard to return after the probation period. The risk of a failed purchase decision is enormous, which is why it demands such careful deliberation. <small>(This is also why companies should avoid low-density hiring out of urgency without a proper exit strategy.)</small></p>\n<p>As producers, to increase the probability of selling our abilities, we need to gather information about our customers — what culture and characteristics the company has, what kind of talent they’re currently looking for, whether our abilities can solve their business or technical problems — and develop a strategy for how to sell our abilities to that specific company.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the labor market is still a market. To sell our abilities to companies and receive better compensation, we need to think not only about “How can I become a better developer? (How can I make a better product?)” but also about consumer-centric questions like “What kind of talent do our customers want to hire? (What kind of product do they want to buy?)”</p>\n<p>The third perspective shift for surviving the market is to stop viewing employment as an administrative process of taking a company’s test, passing, and becoming a member of that organization — and instead see it as an economic activity where you jump into the market, promote your abilities, and match customer needs to create buying interest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adopt-a-professional-mindset\" style=\"position:relative;\">Adopt a Professional Mindset<a href=\"#adopt-a-professional-mindset\" aria-label=\"adopt a professional mindset permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve recognized and accepted that you’re just another participant in a market driven by capital and selfish choices, it’s time to think about how to maximize your own gains.</p>\n<p>Earlier, I discussed three perspective shifts:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognizing that workers and companies can be players transacting on equal terms</li>\n<li>Recognizing that both workers and companies are selfish actors moving to maximize their own interests</li>\n<li>Recognizing that employment is an economic activity where you sell your abilities to someone</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Once you define the relationship as one between equals, the company is no longer an “employer” but a “customer” who buys your abilities.

But think about it.</p>\n<p>What we do when we get a job isn’t really different from a famous athlete or a star instructor signing a contract with a team or academy for high pay. Either way, you’re signing a contract to provide your abilities to someone in exchange for money, and your freedom is constrained while providing those abilities.</p>\n<p>Athletes and instructors often work even harder than the average office worker, who can fulfill their contractual obligations and go home after 8-10 hours.</p>\n<p>Yet we call those people professionals, not serfs. It’s strange logic to say that if your job title is “office worker” you’re a serf, but if you’re a sports star you’re a professional — when both are providing abilities to others for money.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/b918a/3hours.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"3hours\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/6af66/3hours.png\" srcset=\"/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/69538/3hours.png 160w,\n/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/72799/3hours.png 320w,\n/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/6af66/3hours.png 640w,\n/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/d9199/3hours.png 960w,\n/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/21b4d/3hours.png 1280w,\n/static/8e3c67ff3ff3aaa10d73f7e7815e6b13/b918a/3hours.png 2780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    Honestly, the working conditions of a star instructor earning $10M a year are far more intense than most office workers'.<br>But nobody would call them a corporate serf.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>As long as we live as working professionals, the fact that we provide labor to others in exchange for compensation doesn’t change.

And this is arguably the only point in the labor market where the seller can hold an advantageous position.</p>\n<p>That’s why, as sellers, we need to think very seriously about our sales strategy — how to communicate and brand the information about the product we’re offering to buyers.</p>\n<p>Building such a strategy starts with understanding the value of the product you’re bringing to market. You need to know your product’s strengths and the value those strengths carry before you can figure out what to emphasize and how to position yourself.</p>\n<p>While self-reflection on your strengths and weaknesses is valuable, an even easier method is to just go out into the market and try selling your abilities.</p>\n<p>Quality standards in the market are relative. When demand far outstrips supply, even lower-quality products can fetch high prices. When supply is abundant and demand is scarce, buyers demand higher quality.</p>\n<p>So rather than sitting at home strategizing about how to increase your product’s value, just go into the field, make a sales attempt, and gauge the customer’s reaction and the price you’re offered. You’ll learn much faster what the market currently thinks your product is worth.</p>\n<p>That’s why I often tell people who are thinking about growth: “Meet as many different developers as you can” and “Even if you get rejected, interviewing frequently and often is always beneficial.”</p>\n<p>Interviewing frequently is something I can’t emphasize enough. Through the process, you learn current labor market trends, identify gaps in your product based on questions you couldn’t answer well, and if you pass and receive an offer, you learn the market price for your product.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d38dfcd13f8d28ee989c50f5a7fbb9f5/e5166/interview.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 52.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"interview\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/d38dfcd13f8d28ee989c50f5a7fbb9f5/c08c5/interview.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d38dfcd13f8d28ee989c50f5a7fbb9f5/0913d/interview.jpg 160w,\n/static/d38dfcd13f8d28ee989c50f5a7fbb9f5/cb69c/interview.jpg 320w,\n/static/d38dfcd13f8d28ee989c50f5a7fbb9f5/c08c5/interview.jpg 640w,\n/static/d38dfcd13f8d28ee989c50f5a7fbb9f5/6a068/interview.jpg 960w,\n/static/d38dfcd13f8d28ee989c50f5a7fbb9f5/e5166/interview.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Networking and interviewing are the best forms of market research</small>\n</center>\n<p>Once you’ve used these methods to understand your product’s value and approximate price, take a look at this table:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\"></th>\n<th align=\"center\">Low quality</th>\n<th align=\"center\">High quality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><strong>Sell cheap</strong></td>\n<td align=\"center\">Low reward / Low cost</td>\n<td align=\"center\">You just lose out</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><strong>Sell expensive</strong></td>\n<td align=\"center\">Hustler / Cost-efficient</td>\n<td align=\"center\">High reward / High cost</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I think every quadrant except “high quality / sell cheap” — which is just a pure loss — is a viable strategy.</p>\n<p>Selling a low-quality product cheaply might look like someone doing the bare minimum without expecting additional rewards (quiet quitting) or someone just starting their career. Selling a high-quality product at a premium represents highly-paid key talent at companies.</p>\n<p>The interesting one is the quadrant where a low-quality product is sold at a high price. This could be someone who lacks substance but has accumulated years and thus a high salary, someone whose branding presents a more impressive image than their actual skills, or someone doing work that’s easy for them but appears costly to others.</p>\n<p>Selling cheap goods at high margins is the basis of business, but in the labor market, the seller can’t be separated from the product. If a defect is discovered, things get awkward fast.</p>\n<p>If the exaggeration is severe, it’ll get exposed during interviews or after joining. And if the inflated branding led to a price far exceeding the product’s actual value, word spreads among companies, and eventually nobody will buy.</p>\n<p>This quadrant also represents the worst ROI for customers, so when cash flow gets tight, these are the first people to face layoffs.</p>\n<p>That’s why I believe that in the labor market, rather than selling low-quality products at high prices, the better long-term strategy is to sell genuinely high-quality products at premium prices and build trust with your market’s customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"it-takes-more-fierce-effort-and-thinking-than-youd-expect\" style=\"position:relative;\">It Takes More Fierce Effort and Thinking Than You’d Expect<a href=\"#it-takes-more-fierce-effort-and-thinking-than-youd-expect\" aria-label=\"it takes more fierce effort and thinking than youd expect permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>So what does “high quality” mean in the labor market?</p>\n<p>There’s no definitive answer. People who command top compensation in the labor market don’t just excel at their hard skills — they stand out across many dimensions: leadership, communication, business insight, persuasion, networking, and organizational savvy.</p>\n<p>If you thought being a developer means you only need to be good at programming, think again. Programming skill is merely the baseline for working as a developer at a reasonable salary. If you want more, you need to develop skills beyond programming.</p>\n<p>Of course, no one can be perfect at everything, so it’s important to clearly identify your strengths and weaknesses and build your own unique character.</p>\n<p>This character can’t be gained through study alone — it’s a conclusion reached through endless deliberation and effort: analyzing market demand for talent, understanding your own characteristics, evaluating the competitiveness of your character itself. That’s why I said there’s no silver bullet.</p>\n<p>The market is already full of people fighting tooth and nail to prove their value. This is especially true in industries where the gap in compensation between the top few and everyone else is enormous — I’ve seen it particularly in sports, arts, and food service.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Here’s what you really need to understand: from the moment you start getting paid, in any world, any field, any profession — there are no amateurs. Once you start getting paid, you’re a professional. So what do you have to do? Act like one.” — Edward Kwon, celebrity chef</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you feel nothing after losing an important match, you’re no longer a professional. It has nothing to do with character — for a competitor, the pain of defeat must always be raw and vivid. You can’t always be the winner, but you must never become accustomed to the role of the loser.” — Lee Chang-ho, 9-dan Go player</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Being a professional is about doing all the things you have to do on the days you don’t want to do them.” — Julius Erving</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Focus on what we need to do! Every one of you gets paid to play. Win the game! Don’t lose! Don’t tie! Do it right! That’s what I want. Don’t be afraid, don’t be nervous, give it everything you’ve got! Sacrifice yourselves for the team. We’re the Lotte Giants! We need to be the best!” — Jerry Royster, baseball manager</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In sports, I believe second place is the same as last.” — Sun Dong-yul, legendary Korean baseball pitcher</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The IT industry I work in provides decent compensation even if you’re not number one, so the competition isn’t quite as fierce as in those fields. But if you want more than what you’re currently getting, the truth remains the same — you need that mindset, that level of fierce effort and deliberation.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/57a2f0c10fbf684c1b6233cc9bbf3a34/a8a14/janghoon.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 51.87500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"janghoon\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/57a2f0c10fbf684c1b6233cc9bbf3a34/c08c5/janghoon.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/57a2f0c10fbf684c1b6233cc9bbf3a34/0913d/janghoon.jpg 160w,\n/static/57a2f0c10fbf684c1b6233cc9bbf3a34/cb69c/janghoon.jpg 320w,\n/static/57a2f0c10fbf684c1b6233cc9bbf3a34/c08c5/janghoon.jpg 640w,\n/static/57a2f0c10fbf684c1b6233cc9bbf3a34/a8a14/janghoon.jpg 885w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>A professional must always evaluate themselves coldly and put in bone-grinding effort to better satisfy their customers.</small>\n</center>\n<p>Once you define yourself not as a mere worker but as a professional selling your abilities and skills on the market, your perspective on countless phenomena happening around you starts to shift.</p>\n<p>If a colleague doing seemingly the same work as you is earning a higher salary, you should compare and analyze their career against yours, check whether they possess capabilities you don’t, and recalibrate your own development direction.</p>\n<p>When it’s time to negotiate salary with your company, don’t passively wait for the company to recognize your achievements. Instead, think about how to present your accomplishments in a persuasive format. Proactively go out into the market to get offers from other companies, learn what the market values your skills at, and consider whether you can use that information as a negotiation tool.</p>\n<p>Not doing any of this is like someone who wants to run a business but just sits in their store without any promotion, waiting for customers to walk in.

I even heard recently that an acquaintance of mine started studying development — so this perception is still alive and well.</p>\n<p>It’s true that as the IT industry grew, demand for developers gradually increased while supply fell short. Back when I was in college in 2015, the popular engineering majors were the “Big Three” — electrical, chemical, and mechanical engineering — and computer science wasn’t particularly sought after.</p>\n<p>Then a certain company dramatically raised developer salaries and started a war to vacuum up developers from the market. Other companies, well aware that supply was woefully short relative to their demand for good developers, had no choice but to join the chicken game of salary escalation. <small>(I think this was a kind of FOMO phenomenon.)</small></p>\n<p>But as of 2023, things are very different. As developer compensation rose rapidly in recent years, the perception of the developer profession improved, computer science programs gained prestige, bootcamps proliferated as a new business model, and the supply of developers in the market increased.</p>\n<p>Then an economic downturn hit, and suddenly demand isn’t keeping up with supply. It might still look like demand for developers is high, but look closer and it’s not.</p>\n<p>Labor prices have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">downward rigidity</a> — once they go up, they don’t easily come back down — so even when demand drops, it’s hard to suddenly lower prices.</p>\n<p>Our customers end up paying above the equilibrium price naturally formed by supply and demand, so they become more selective about high-quality products. This leads to involuntary unemployment — layoffs or inability to find work — and wage polarization among developers.</p>\n<p>Sellers providing high-value labor receive more compensation, while sellers providing low-value labor find no buyers at all or receive even lower offers than before. <small>(It’s easier for a company to spend $100K on one highly capable person than to hire three less capable people at the same total cost.)</small></p>\n<p>These market changes are critically important for developers, especially those just starting their careers.</p>\n<p>Looking at the stock market might make it seem like the economy is recovering, but nothing has actually been resolved — it’s a difficult market for everyone. In this environment, I simply cannot bring myself to say “just work hard and the rewards will follow.” That advice worked when times were good, not now.</p>\n<p>Yet amid these rapidly changing market conditions, there’s plenty of talk about how learning TypeScript, React, and Next.js leads to employment, or how Rust is the latest trend — but hardly anyone talks about these practical realities. I’m not sure why.</p>\n<p>I believe technology matters, but you need a stable life first before you can enjoy the technologies you love. Learning driven by intellectual curiosity rather than survival is far healthier for your growth.</p>\n<p>I hope many developers never forget that before being a developer, you’re a working professional and a market participant. I hope you develop the cold-eyed market perspective needed to analyze and respond to difficult situations like the current one.</p>\n<p>That wraps up this post on becoming someone who survives the

주니어 분들은 대부분 성장에 목말라 있었고, 필자는 주로 성장의 모티베이션과 꾸준한 노력, 메타인지와 같이 성장에 대한 고찰을 해볼 수 있는 주제를 주로 전달해드렸었다.</p>\n<p>그리고 보상에 대한 질문을 해주시는 분께는 이런 말을 자주 했었다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>성장해서 유능한 개발자가 되면 보상은 자연스럽게 따라와요.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>물론 어느 정도는 맞는 말이다. 하지만 일을 잘 한다고 해서 보상이 저절로 생긴다기보다는 좋은 기회가 찾아왔을 때 잡을 수 있는 역량을 보유하는 것에 가깝다. 애초에 일을 잘 하는 것과 돈을 잘 버는 것은 약간은 다른 맥락이다.</p>\n<p>세상에는 꾸준한 노력으로 좋은 실력을 쌓더라도 아무도 알아주지 않아 신입 개발자보다도 적은 보상을 받는 시니어 개발자도 존재하며, 반대로 딱히 프로그래밍 실력이 좋지 않음에도 퍼스널 브랜딩을 통해 높은 보상을 챙겨가는 개발자도 존재한다.</p>\n<p>물론 기본적으로 개발자의 프로그래밍 역량이 좋을수록 좋은 보상을 받을 확률이 높다는 것은 사실이다. 다만 아무리 프로그래밍 역량이 좋다고 해도 가만히 앉아만 있다면 아무도 그 능력을 알아주지 않을 가능성이 높으며, 솔직히 정말 상위 1%의 두각을 나타내는 개발자가 아닌 이상 어느 정도 연차가 차면 프로그래밍 스킬 자체는 도찐개찐인 경우가 대부분이다.</p>\n<p>성실하게 노력하는 사람이 그에 비례하여 보상받는다는 아름다운 스토리는 누군가의 모티베이션이 될 수 있겠지만, 막상 현실을 자세히 들여다보면 슬프게도 그렇지 않은 경우가 더 많다는 것을 알 수 있다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 이 포스팅에서 성장에 대한 이야기보다는 조금 더 현실적인 시장에 대한 이야기를 하려고 한다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"시장이라는-게임에-대한-기본적-이해도를-높히자\" style=\"position:relative;\">시장이라는 게임에 대한 기본적 이해도를 높히자<a

재화와 기업이 가진 금전적 재화를 맞바꿈하는 기본원리를 가지고 있다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>어떻게 보면 굉장히 간단하고 명확한 내용이지만, 실제로 우리는 실생활 속에서 이 개념을 자주 잊고는 한다. 우리가 시장이라는 냉정한 게임에서 살아남기 위해 가장 먼저 해야 하는 것은 이 노동시장에 대한 시각 자체를 바꾸는 것이다.</p>\n<p>시장은 구성원들이 각자가 얻을 수 있는 최대의 이익을 위해 의사결정하며 나아가는 게임이다. 시장에서 발생하는 많은 의사결정들을 모델링하고 연구하는 <a href=\"https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84%EC%9D%B4%EB%A1%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">게임이론</a>은 많지만

석방</td>\n<td align=\"center\">둘 다 1년형</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>죄수의 딜레마 게임의 특징은 개인에게는 각자 최선이 될 수 있는 선택을 해도 결과적으로는 최선이 아닐 수 있다는 것이다. 나와 상대 모두 침묵을 선택한다면 둘 다 1년형이라는 결과로 이어지겠지만 내가 침묵을 한 상태일 때 상대방이 자백을 하게 되면 나만 10년형을 살게 될 수도 있는 리스크가 존재한다.</p>\n<p>결국은 양 쪽 모두 상대가 어떤 행동을 취하든 자신에게 큰 이득을 주는 자백을 선택하게 되고 함께 사이좋게 3년형을 살게 되는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이는 마치 핵무기가 없는 것이 범지구적으로는 이로운 행위임이 분명함에도 핵무기를 없애는 선택을 쉽사리 하지 못 하는 상황과도 유사하며, 시장에서 발생하는 수 많은 인터랙션도 결국은 전체의 이익보다는 자신의 이익을 위해 움직이게 되는 경향이 크기 때문에 이와 크게 다르지 않다.</p>\n<p>그럼 어려운 이야기는 이제 접어두고 시장에 대한 시각을 바꾸기 위해 많은 직장인의 관심사인 연봉에 대한 이야기를 먼저 해보도록 하자.</p>\n<h3

기간이 늘어나거나 이직을 통해 올릴 수 있는 가치라고 생각하고 있지만 사실 연봉이라는 것은 생각보다 냉정한 시장의 평가를 기반으로 결정된다.</p>\n<p>그러니 연봉을 높히기 위해서는 우선 연봉이라는 것이 그저 일을 오래 한다고 해서 오르는 것이 아니라, 시장에서 결정되는 내 능력과 노동력에 대한 가격이라는 것을 명확히 인지하고 인정해야한다. 우리는 능력과 노동력을 판매하는 대신 구매자인 기업으로부터 연봉이라는 가치를 제공받는 일종의 거래를 하고 있는 것이다.</p>\n<p>결국 자본주의 시장 경제에서 발생하는 모든 인터랙션은 가치와 가치를 교환하는 거래에서부터 출발하며, 결국 판매자인 내가 제공하는 기술력과 노동력의 가치가 높다고 판단될수록 구매자인 기업은 나에게 더 높은 금액을 지불한다.</p>\n<p>필자는 자신의 능력이 전혀 성장하지 않았음에도 불구하고 지금보다 더 높은 연봉을 요구하는 상황은 마치 아무런 개선사항도 없는 물건을 팔면서 내 마진을 더 남기기 위해 소비자에게 더 높은 가격을 쳐달라고 하는 것과 별반 다르지 않다고 생각한다. <small>(별다른 정당성 없이 치킨 가격을 올렸을 때 소비자들의 반응이 어땠는지를 생각해보자)</small></p>\n<p>즉, 시장에서 연봉을 높일 수 있는 가장 기본적인 원칙은 <strong>내가 판매하는 상품인 기술력과 노동력의 가치를 먼저 올린 이후에 딜을 걸어야 한다는 것</strong>이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:

것과 크게 다르지 않다.</small>\n</center>\n<p>물론 노동시장에서의 거래는 판매자인 우리의 정보력과 구매자인 기업의 정보력에 차이가 있는 경우가 많기 때문에 아무런 준비가 되어있지 않은 상태라면 기본적으로 판매자가 불리한 위치에서 거래를 진행하여 양질의 노동력을 시세보다 싼 값에 제공하게 되는 상황에 처하기 쉽다.</p>\n<p>하지만 결국 근본적으로는 이 또한 시장에서 발생하는 거래이기 때문에 각자가 보유한 정보력, 판매하는 상품의 상대적 가치, 수요와 공급, 협상 능력, 시장의 상황과 같은 여러가지 요인에 따라 이러한 위치는 얼마든지 뒤바뀔 수도 있다.</p>\n<p>노동시장에서 기업이 무조건 갑이고 노동자가 무조건 을일 것이라고 생각하는 것과 달리, 실제로는 양질의 노동력과 정보력을 가져 기업과의 거래에서 유리한 위치를 점하는 노동자들 또한 분명 존재한다. 단지 이 정도 능력을 가진 노동자의 비율이 현저히 적기 때문에 마치 항상 불리한 위치일 것이라고 보여지는 것 뿐이다.</p>\n<p>애초에 어떤 사람의 연봉이 높다는 것은 그 사람이 제공하는 노동력의 가치가 그만큼 높고 수요도 많지만 그 수요를 충족시킬 정도의 공급은 부족한 상황이라는 것을 의미한다. 이 정도 역량을 지닌 노동자는 기업의 규모와 상관없이 모든 기업이 채용하고 싶을테니 기업들 간에 경쟁이 붙기도 한다.</p>\n<p>이처럼 양질의 노동력을 제공할 수 있는 노동자들은 시장에서 기업보다 유리한 위치를 점하고 있는 경우가 많기 때문에 이력서를 넣고 면접을 보는 과정보다는 기업의 연략을 받고 커피챗이나 풀링 디너를 통해 기업에 대한 정보를 얻고 마음에 드는 회사로 이직하는 과정을 경험하기도 한다. 결국 노동 시장에서의 절대적인 갑과 을은 없는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이는 일반적인 시장에서 발생하는 거래라고 생각해보면 너무나도 당연한 사실들이지만, 앞서 말한 노동시장의 특징과 더불어 대부분의 노동자가 거래에 임할 때 상대적 약자의 위치인 경우가 많다는 사실로 인해 일반적인 시장과는 약간 다른 시각으로 이 시장을 바라보게 되는 것이다.</p>\n<p>시장에서 살아남기 위한 첫 번째 시각 전환은 스스로를 노비처럼 여기는 자조섞인 마인드를 버리고 내가 기업과 상호평등한 관계에서 거래를 할 수 있는 플레이어가 될 수 있다는 것을 인지하여, 스스로를 생산성있는 고민과 전략을 짤 수 있는 상태로 만드는 것이다.</p>\n<h3

Governance가 건전하지 않아 기업이 어려워졌는데 노동자가 해고를 당해 생존권에 위협을 받는다던가 하는 일들은 그렇게 드문 일이 아니니 말이다.</p>\n<p>물론 우리는 노동자의 입장인 경우가 많으니 상대적으로 공감이 덜 되는 기업의 입장보다는 노동자의 입장에 더 감정 이입이 되는 것을 부정할 수는 없다. 하지만 이런 상황들 또한 냉정하게 바라보면 그저 각자의 이익을 위해서 싸우고 있는 게임 참여자들간의 협력과 배신의 연속이라고 볼 수 있다.</p>\n<p>애초에 노조라는 개념 자체가 기업과 평등한 위치에서 거래를 진행하여 노동자들의 이익을 얻기 위해 뭉친 집단이며, 당연히 대부분의 의사결정은 기업이 아닌 노동자들의 이익을 위한 방향으로 진행된다. 반대로 기업 입장에서는 노동자보다는 기업에 이익이 되는 방향으로 의사결정을 진행할 것이다.</p>\n<p>서두에서 이야기했듯이 기본적으로 시장은 모든 구성원이 법이 허락하는 선 안에서 자신의 최대 이익을 위해 이기적으로 행동하는 게임이다. 그러니 시장에서 살아남기 위해서는 선과 악이라는 감정적 판단보다는 상황을 냉정하게 분석하고 최선의 의사결정을 할 수 있는 논리적 판단과 중립적인 시각이 필요하다.</p>\n<p>판매자인 우리는 우리가 가진 능력을 비싼 가격에 팔고 싶겠지만 반대로 구매자인 기업은 최대한 싼 가격에 사고 싶어한다. 이런 사실 또한 일반적인 시장 거래라고 생각해보면 너무나도 당연한 것이며, 비싼 가격을 요구하는 노동자에게 양심없다고 할 이유도 없고 싼 가격을 요구하는 기업이 악덕 기업이라고 할 만한 이유도 없다.</p>\n<center>\n  <div style=\"max-width: 300px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:

조용한 퇴직과 같은 행위를 하는 것이나 처음 계약 조건에는 없었던 무리한 복지를 요구하는 것, 인터뷰 때 보여줬던 열정적인 모습과 다르게 입사 후 대충 일을 하는 등의 불공정 거래도 존재하기 마련이다.</p>\n<p>이처럼 거래 상대방에 대한 평가는 상대적이기 때문에 절대적인 선이나 절대적인 악은 없다.</p>\n<p>결국은 기업이든 노동자든 시장에서 서로의 이익을 위해 이기적으로 행동하는 평등한 게임 참여자일 뿐이다. 만약 시장에서 노동자의 기본 포지션이 상대적 약자라면 우리는 이를 인정하고 이 포지션을 뒤집을 수 있는 전략을 떠올리고 실행하면 그만이다.</p>\n<p>시장에서 성공적인 거래를 진행하기 위해서는 내 입장만 생각하는 것이 아니라 거래에 임하는 상대방의 입장과 심리를 이해하고 적절한 조건을 제시하는 전략이 필수적이다. 물론 상대방에게 통수를 한번 맞은 이후에도 굳이 협력할 필요는 없으니, 일종의 <a href=\"https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%8C%83%ED%8F%AC%ED%83%AF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">팃포탯</a> 전략이라고 생각하는 것이 좋다.</p>\n<p>팃포탯은 첫 번째는 협력으로 시작하되 상대가 배신을 하면 똑같이 갚아주고 협력을 하면 똑같이 협력해주는 전략이다. 노동자와 기업의 딜은 주로 처우 협의 때 발생하니, 첫 처우 협의 때는 어느 정도 협력을 해주되 이후 연봉 협상 때 원하는 결과가 나오지 않는다면 굳이 남아있지 않고 다른 곳으로의 이직을 검토해보는 등의 방식을 생각해볼 수 있다.</p>\n<p>연협이 불발되었을 때 “난 그렇게 헌신했는데 회사가 어떻게 나에게 이럴 수 있냐”라는 등 감정적인 어프로치를 하시는 분들도 있지만, 어차피 내가 원하는 가격을 쳐주지 않는 구매자에게 감정적인 대응을 해봤자 상대방은 절대로 내가 원하는 것을 거저 내어주지 않는다.</p>\n<p>나에게 아메리카노 한 잔을 8만원에 팔려고 하는 카페 사장에게 “커피가 너무 비싸서 안 살래요”라고 이야기했을 때, 사장님이 나에게 “이게 뭐가 비싸요!!”라며 화를 내거나 “제가 가정형편이 어려워서…”라고 동정을 유도해도 내가 그 커피를 사주지 않을 것이라는 걸 생각해보면 된다. 차라리 아메리카노 한 잔에 8만원을 받아야 하는 합리적 근거를 제시하는 편이 더 확률이 높을 것이다.</p>\n<p>결국 우리가 기업에게 노동력을 제공하며 원하는 가격을 받기 위한 효과적인 전략을 만들기 위해서는 시장이라는 게임과 나와 거래하는 상대방인 기업에 대해서 이해하고 서로가 Win-Win할 수 있는 방법에 대해서 고민해야한다.</p>\n<p>시장에서 살아남기 위한 두 번째 시각 전환은 나와 기업 모두 자신의 이익을 최대로 만들기 위한 의사결정을 하는 플레이어 중 하나일 뿐임을 인정하고, 거래 결과에 대한 감정적인 대응보다는 현상 그대로를 바라볼 수 있는 객관적 시각을 길러 상대방이 원하는 것이 무엇인지, 어떻게 접근해야 구매 욕구를 불러일으킬 수 있을지에 대해 냉철하게 판단할 수 있는 상태로 나아가는 것이다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customer-centric\"

같은 전략은 존재하기 어렵기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>단지 필자는 여러분이 이러한 전략에 대한 고민을 시작할 수 있도록 노동시장을 바라보는 시각과 기본 개념을 바꿀 수 있는 약간의 도움만 드릴 수 있을 뿐이다.</p>\n<p>앞서 이야기했듯이 우리는 노동시장에서 우리의 능력을 기업에게 팔아야 하는 판매자 혹은 생산자의 입장이다. 즉, 우리의 능력을 하나의 상품으로 생각하고 고객들이 내 상품을 구매한다는 결정을 내리기 위해 어떤 정보들이 필요한 지에 대해서 생각해봐야 한다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이렇게 이야기하면 어떻게 사람을 상품으로 보고 가격을 매기냐고 생각하시는 분들도 계시겠지만, 이미 우리는 기업에게 노동력을 제공하고 연봉을 받고 있지 않은가? 그게 바로 우리에게 매겨진 가격이다. 더 정확하게 이야기하면 인간 자체가 아닌 인간이 <strong>보유한 능력에 대해 매겨진 가격</strong>이라고 할 수 있다. <small>(인간 채용이 아니라 재능을 가진 인간을 채용한다는 인재 채용이라는 단어를 사용하는 이유이다)</small></p>\n<p>물론 이 가격이 형성될 때 최저임금제와 같이 기본적인 생존권을 보장하기 위한 팩터가 포함되기는 하지만, 기본적으로는 그저 상품에 대한 수요와 공급에 의해 형성된 가격일 뿐이다.</p>\n<p>사실 노동시장에서 고객들이 우리의 능력을 구매하는 행위는 우리가 쿠팡과 같은 온라인 커머스 플랫폼에서 매우 비싼 상품을 구매하는 상황과 크게 다르지 않다. 예를 들어 로봇 청소기를 하나 장만해야 한다고 생각해보자.</p>\n<center>\n  <span

</span>\n  <small>로봇 청소기 생각보다 비싸다...</small>\n</center>\n<p>온라인을 통해 상품을 구매할 때는 해당 상품을 직접 사용해볼 수 없다는 특징이 있다. 게다가 만약 몇 천원 짜리 상품을 구매한다면 그냥 대충 지를 수 있겠지만, 로봇 청소기와 같은 고가의 제품을 구매할 때는 내 소중한 돈을 엄한 곳에 쓰지 않기 위해 신중해질 수 밖에 없을 것이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 우리는 기본적으로 상품 상세 페이지를 자세히 읽어 보고 다른 구매자들이 작성한 리뷰나 별점도 살펴보고 유튜브와 같은 다른 SNS에 올라온 리뷰까지 확인한 이후 “음, 이 정도면 나쁘지 않은 소비구만”이라는 생각이 들면 구매를 결정하게 된다. <small><del>(물론 성향따라 그냥 지르시는 분들도 계시긴 하다…)</del></small></p>\n<p>우리의 능력을 사는 고객들도 마찬가지이다. 노동시장에서의 구매자는 우리의 능력을 직접 경험해보고 구매를 결정할 수 없으며, 기본적으로 우리가 제출한 단순한 상품 소개서(이력서)와 총 2시간 정도의 방문판매영업(인터뷰), 혹은 이 상품을 구매했던 다른 고객들의 리뷰(레퍼런스 체크) 등을 기반으로 구매를 결정하게 된다.</p>\n<p>즉, 이 단계에서는 상품의 실제 스펙보다는 해당 상품을 소개하는 정보들과 타인의 리뷰들을 기반으로 한 판단이 구매 결정에 큰 영향을 끼치게 될 수 밖에 없다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>심지어 인간의 능력이라는 상품은 1년에 몇 천만원에서 몇 억원이나 지불해야 할 정도로 매우 비싼 상품인데다가, 한번 구매하고 나서 3개월이 지나면 환불도 어려워서 구매 의사결정이 실패했을 때의 리스크가 굉장히 크니 매우 신중하게 결정할 수 밖에 없다. <small>(당장 손이 급하다는 이유로 별다른 출구 전략도 없이 인재밀도가 낮은 채용을 해버리는 것을 최대한 피해야 하는 이유이기도 하다)</small></p>\n<p>그러니 우리는 생산자로써 내 능력의 판매 확률을 높이기 위해 구매자인 기업이 어떤 문화와 특성을 가지고 있는지, 현재 어떤 인재를 찾고 있는지, 내 능력으로 그 기업이 가진 비즈니스 문제나 기술적 문제를 해결할 수 있는지와 같이 고객들에 대한 다양한 정보를 수집하여, 어떤 방법으로 내가 가진 능력을 해당 기업에 팔아볼 지에 대한 전략을 세우는 과정을 거쳐야 한다.</p>\n<p>결국 노동시장도 시장이다. 결국 우리가 이 시장에서 기업들에게 내 능력을 판매하며 더 많은 보상을 받기 위해서는 “어떻게 하면 좋은 개발자가 될 수 있을까?(좋은 상품을 만들 수 있을까?)”와 같은 고민 뿐만 아니라 “우리 고객들은 어떤 인재를 채용하고 싶을까?(어떤 상품을 구매하고 싶을까?)”와 같은 소비자 중심의 고민들도 함께 해야한다.</p>\n<p>시장에서 살아남기 위한 세 번째 시각 전환은 취업이라는 활동을 단순히 기업이 내는 시험을 보고 합격하여 그 기업의 소속이 되는 행정적 과정이 아니라, 내가 직접 시장에 뛰어들어 내 능력을 홍보하고 고객의 니즈를 맞춰 구매 욕구를 불러일으켜야 하는 일종의 경제 활동으로 바라보는 것이다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"프로페셔널의-마음가짐을-가지자\"

이야기했었다.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>노동자와 기업이 상호평등한 거래를 할 수 있는 플레이어가 될 수 있음을 인지하기</li>\n<li>노동자와 기업이 모두 자신의 이익을 최대로 만들기 위해 움직이는 이기적인 녀석들임을 인지하기</li>\n<li>취업이라는 활동이 내가 누군가에게 내 능력을 판매해야하는 경제 활동임을 인지하기</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>이렇게 서로를 평등한 관계로 정의하고나면 이제 기업은 “고용주”가 아닌 나의 능력을 구매해주는 “고객”이 된다. 애초에 기업은 내 노동력과 기술력을 사준 대상이지 나라는 인간 자체를 산 것이 아니니 주인이라고 할 수도 없다.</p>\n<p>물론 노동시장의 특성 상 판매하는 상품인 노동력과 판매자인 노동자가 분리될 수 없다는 점과 노동력을 제공하고 있는 시간 동안은 구매자인 기업에 의해 내 자유가 억압당할 수 있다는 점으로 인해 스스로를 노비라고 느끼는 분들도 있겠지만, 한번 잘 생각해보자.</p>\n<p>사실 우리가 회사에 취업하는 것이나 유명한 스포츠 스타나 학원 강사가 고액 연봉을 받고 특정 구단이나 학원으로 입단하는 것은 크게 다르지 않다. 어차피 돈 받고 타인에게 내 능력을 제공하는 계약을 체결하고 그 능력을 제공하는 동안은 자유가 억압당한다는 사실은 똑같기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>심지어 스포츠 스타나 학원 강사는 하루 8-10시간 정도 일하면 계약 조건을 만족시키고 퇴근할 자유가 있는 대다수의 직장인에 비해 업무 강도도 높은 편이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 그런 사람들을 보고 우리는 구단주나 학원의 노비가 아닌 프로페셔널이라고 한다. 똑같이 돈을 받고 타인에게 능력을 제공하는데도 직업이 직장인이면 노비이고 스포츠 스타면 프로페셔널이라고 하는 것은 다소 이상한 논리이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;

모르냐고</small>\n</center>\n<p>꽤나 거창하게 이야기했지만 사실 기업이라는 집단이 돈을 벌기 위해 존재한다는 사실은 지나가는 초등학생도 다 아는 사실이다.</p>\n<p>우리 회사에 투자한 투자자들은 추후 이 기업이 지금보다 더 돈을 많이 벌어 더 높은 가치를 가지게 될 것을 기대하고 막대한 금액을 투자한 사람들이며, 자신들의 이익을 위해 투자한 금액이 먼지가 되어버릴 수도 있는 리스크를 안고 판에 뛰어든 사람들이다.</p>\n<p>물론 CEO들 중에서는 기업을 통해 돈보다 자신들의 비전이나 꿈을 실현하는 것을 목표로 삼는 분들도 있지만, 결국 영리 집단을 운영하는 이상 돈을 벌지 않으면 그 꿈을 이룰 수 조차 없다는 사실에는 모두 공감하실 것이다.</p>\n<p>그럼에도 불구하고 굳이 필자가 이렇게 당연한 이야기를 강조하는 이유는 우리가 생각보다 기업이라는 조직이 <strong>돈을 버는 것이 최우선순위인 영리 집단</strong>이라는 사실을 종종 잊기 때문이다. 바로 이 사실을 이해하고 인정하는 것부터가 우리의 고객을 이해하기 위한 첫 걸음이다.</p>\n<p>왜냐하면 기업은 돈을 벌어야만 하는 집단이기 때문에 돈이 될 것이라고 생각되지 않으면 절대 우리를 채용하지 않기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>결국 기업이 우리와 1년 어치의 연봉을 계약하는 행위는 작게는 몇 천만원 크게는 몇 억원 규모의 선물 투자를 하는 것이나 마찬가지이다. <small>(선물 계약에 대해서 잘 모른다면 <a

알아야 할 스톡옵션의 모든 것 포스팅</a>을 한번 보고 오자)</small></p>\n<p>그러니 여러분이 어떤 기업과 연봉 8천만원짜리 고용계약을 맺었다면, 당연히 그 이면에는 여러분이 1년 동안 기업에 벌어다 줄 금전적/비금전적 가치가 8천만원 이상일 것이라고 기대하고 있다는 사실이 숨어있다. 애초에 기업은 우리의 행복이나 워라밸보다 돈을 버는 것이 최우선 목표인 집단이라는 사실을 잊지말자.</p>\n<p>쉽게 말해 기업은 사람을 채용할 때 투자의 개념으로 접근하게 된다는 것이며, 이는 결국 투자수익률인 **ROI(Return On Investment)**를 본다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이때 기대하는 비금전적 가치에는 조직 문화 빌딩이나 조직의 역량/행복도 향상 같은 것들이 포함될 수 있는데, 이 또한 결과적으로는 조직이 지속적으로 높은 생산성을 유지하여 기업의 이익을 만들어내기 위함이다. 만약 기업이 직원들의 행복도만 우선시하여 챙겨주느라 정작 돈도 못 벌고 망해버린다면 직원도 직장을 잃게 되니 결국 기업이 돈을 못 벌면 회사와 직원 모두에게 손해이다.</p>\n<p>이것이 바로 우리의 능력과 노동력을 구매하는 고객들의 본질이며, 우리가 프로페셔널로써 고객들을 만족시키기 위해 반드시 알아둬야 할 팩터이다.</p>\n<p>그러니 결국 우리는 고객들에게 내 노동력을 높은 가격에 팔기 위해서 “나는 내 연봉만큼, 혹은 내 연봉보다 더 큰 이익을 회사에 안겨다 줄 수 있다”라는 사실을 어필해야 하는 것이다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"판매-전략을-고민해보자\"

있다면<br>애초에 면접이라는 과정이 필요 없었을 수도 있지 않을까?</small>\n</center>\n<p>결국 앞서 이야기한 쿠팡의 예시와 같이 우리의 고객들은 상품을 직접 써보기도 전에 대략적인 상품의 정보들만 가지고 구매를 결정해야하는 상황에 놓인다는 것이며, 이것이 바로 노동시장에서 판매자가 거의 유일하게 유리한 위치를 점할 수 있는 지점이라고 봐도 좋다.</p>\n<p>그렇기 때문에 판매자인 우리는 구매자들에게 내가 제공할 상품의 정보를 어떻게 알리고 브랜딩할지와 같은 판매 전략에 대해서 정말 많은 고민을 해야 한다.</p>\n<p>이러한 판매 전략을 만들어나가려면 먼저 내가 시장에 제공할 상품의 가치를 파악하는 과정이 필요하다. 일단 내가 가진 상품의 강점과 그 강점이 가진 가치를 알고 있어야 어떤 점을 강조할 지, 어떤 점을 포장할 지와 같은 판매 전략을 짤 수 있을테니 말이다.</p>\n<p>내 상품의 가치를 알기 위해 나의 강점이나 약점이 무엇인지에 대해서 스스로 고민해보는 부분도 필요하겠지만, 사실 그것보다 더 쉬운 방법은 직접 시장에 나가서 그냥 내 능력을 한번 팔아보는 것이다.</p>\n<p>애초에 시장에서 형성되는 품질에 대한 기준은 상대적이다. 수요에 비해 공급이 많이 부족한 상황이라면 낮은 품질의 상품이라도 비싼 값을 주고 살 수도 있으며, 반대로 수요가 별로 없는데 공급은 넘쳐나는 상황이라면 더 높은 품질의 상품을 요구할테니 말이다.</p>\n<p>그러니 집에 가만히 앉아서 내 상품의 가치를 올릴 전략을 고민하는 것보다는 그냥 필드에 나가서 직접 고객에게 판매 시도를 한 이후 고객의 리액션이나 제시받은 가격 등을 보면 더 빠르게 현재 시장에서 바라보는 내 상품의 가치에 대해서 알아낼 수 있는 것이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 성장을 고민하는 분들에게 “다양한 개발자를 많이 만나보세요”, “면접은 떨어지더라도 무조건 많이 보고 자주 보는 것이 이득이다”라는 이야기를 해드리고는 한다.</p>\n<p>특히 면접을 자주 보는 것은 여러번 얘기해도 부족하지 않을 정도로 중요한데, 이 과정에서 현재 노동시장의 트렌드도 알 수 있고 면접 때 제대로 답변하지 못 한 것들을 토대로 내 상품의 하자가 무엇인지도 알 수 있으며, 심지어 면접에 통과하여 오퍼를 받게 된다면 시장에서 평가한 내 상품의 가격에 대해서도 알 수 있기 때문이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span

“고품질/싸게 팜”을 제외한 나머지는 모두 선택 가능한 전략이라고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>저품질인 상품을 싸게 파는 것은 기업에는 최소한의 노동력만 제공하며 추가적인 보상을 바라지도 않는 조용한 퇴직 같은 상황이나 혹은 일을 시작한지 얼마 되지 않은 분들 같은 케이스일테고, 고품질인 상품을 비싸게 파는 것은 기업의 핵심 인재와 같은 고연봉자들의 케이스라고 볼 수 있다.</p>\n<p>조금 특이한 점은 저품질인 상품을 비싸게 파는 세그먼트가 존재한다는 것인데, 이는 그 동안 밀도있는 경험을 하지 못 해서 실력은 부족한데 연차로 인해 연봉은 높은 경우나 브랜딩을 통해 자신의 실력보다 더 멋진 모습으로 비춰지는 경우, 혹은 나에게는 쉬운 일인데 다른 이들이 볼 때는 비용이 많이 드는 일을 하는 경우라고도 볼 수 있다.</p>\n<p>사실 이렇게 싼 물건을 비싸게 팔아 마진을 남기는 것이 장사의 기본이기는 하지만, 노동 시장의 특성 상 판매자와 판매한 상품을 떼어놓을 수가 없으니 혹여라도 상품에 하자가 발생했을 경우 꽤나 난감한 상황이 발생할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\n<p>어차피 과장 광고가 심한 수준이라면 어차피 면접을 진행할 때 혹은 입사 후에 다 들통나게 되어있으며, 또한 과장 광고로 인해 상품의 가치에 비해 도를 넘는 가격을 받았다면 기업들끼리도 다 소문이 나서 어느 순간부터는 더 이상 구매 자체가 발생하지 않을 수도 있다.</p>\n<p>또한 이 세그먼트는 고객 입장에서 가장 ROI가 나오지 않는 거래이니 기업들의 현금 흐름이 좋지 않아지는 경우가 발생하면 비용을 줄이기 위해 가장 먼저 해고 당할 수 있는 위험 또한 존재한다.</p>\n<p>그러니 필자는 노동 시장에서만큼은 저품질의 상품을 비싸게 파는 것보다는 최대한 고품질인 상품을 비싸게 파는 전략을 선택하여 시장의 고객들과 신뢰를 쌓아가는 것이 장기적으로 더 좋은 전략이라고 생각한다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"생각보다-더-치열한-노력과-고민이-필요하다\"

걸까?</p>\n<p>사실 이 부분은 딱히 정답이랄게 없다. 일반적으로 노동시장에서 고액 연봉을 받는 사람들은 단지 자신의 전문 기술인 하드 스킬만 좋은 것이 아니라 리더십, 커뮤니케이션 스킬, 비즈니스 인사이트, 언변술, 사교술, 정치력 등 다양한 부분에서 두각을 나타내기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>개발자라고 해서 프로그래밍만 잘 해도 된다고 생각했다면 큰 오산이다. 개발자가 프로그래밍을 잘 해야하는 것은 그저 개발자라는 직업으로 적당한 연봉을 받으며 일을 하기 위한 기본기에 불과하며, 그 이상을 바란다면 이제는 프로그래밍이 아닌 것들에 대한 수련이 필요하다.</p>\n<p>물론 인간이 이 모든 것을 완벽하게 하기는 어려우니 자신의 강점과 약점을 명확하게 파악하고 나만의 캐릭터를 구축해나가는 과정이 중요하다.</p>\n<p>이런 캐릭터는 공부로 얻을 수 있는 것이 아니라 시장에서 원하는 인재 수요에 대한 분석, 나 자신의 특성, 캐릭터 자체의 경쟁력 등과 같은 수 없이 많은 고민과 노력을 통해 얻어지는 결론에 가깝다. 그래서 필자가 이 포스팅에서 Silver Bullet과 같은 방법은 없다고 이야기한 것이다.</p>\n<p>이미 치열한 시장 경제 속에서 자신의 가치를 증명하기 위해 죽기 살기로 노력하는 사람들은 널리고 널렸다. 특히 상위의 소수 엘리트와 나머지 인원 간의 보상의 갭이 큰 업계일수록 이러한 성향의 사람들이 더욱 많이 나타나는데, 개인적으로는 스포츠, 예술, 요식 등의 업계에서 이런 모습이 자주 보이는 것 같다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“진짜로 알아야 할 게, 돈을 받고 일하는 순간부터는 어느 세상이든, 어느 세계든, 어느 직업의 장르이건, 아마추어는 존재하지 않아요. 돈을 받기 시작하면 그때부터 프로가 되는 거예요. 그러면 뭘 어떻게 해야 해? 프로답게 해야지.” - <a href=\"https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%97%90%EB%93%9C%EC%9B%8C%EB%93%9C%20%EA%B6%8C\"

업계만큼 치열한 경쟁이 있지는 않겠지만, 만약 현재 받고 있는 것 이상의 보상을 바란다면 저런 마인드를 가지고 치열하게 노력하고 고민해야 한다는 사실은 변하지 않는다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;

싶다.</p>\n<p>물론 IT업계가 발전하며 개발자들에 대한 수요가 조금씩 높아지고 있었고 그에 비해 공급이 부족했던 것은 맞다. 필자가 대학생이던 2015년도만 해도 공대의 꽃은 이른바 전화기<small>(전자전기공학/화학공학/기계공학)</small>였으며 컴퓨터공학과는 딱히 인기가 없었기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>이런 상황에서 특정 기업이 개발자의 연봉을 높여버리며 시장의 개발자들을 대량으로 빨아들이는 전쟁을 시작해버렸고, 당연히 다른 기업들도 좋은 개발자를 데려오고 싶다는 수요에 비해 공급이 턱없이 부족하다는 상황은 알고 있었을테니 그에 맞게 연봉을 높이는 치킨게임에 참여할 수 밖에 없었을 것이다. <small>\n(필자는 이것도 일종의 FOMO 현상이었다고 생각한다.)</small></p>\n<p>하지만 2023년 현재는 상황이 많이 다르다. 최근 몇 년간 개발자들의 몸 값이 빠르게 오르며 개발자라는 직업에 대한 인식이 좋아졌으니 자연스럽게 과거에 비해 컴퓨터공학과의 위상도 많이 올라가고 부트캠프와 같은 새로운 비즈니스 모델까지 우후죽순 생겨나게 되며 시장에는 개발자 공급이 늘어났다.</p>\n<p>이런 상황에서 갑자기 경기 침체가 와버리니 이번에는 공급에 비해 수요가 부족한 상황이 되어가고 있다. 아직은 개발자에 대한 수요가 많아 보일 수 있지만 자세히 보면 아니다.</p>\n<p>노동력에 대한 가격은 한번 오르고 나면 잘 내려가지 않는 <a href=\"https://www.moef.go.kr/sisa/dictionary/detail?idx=2081\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">하방 경직성</a>을 가지고 있기 때문에 수요가 줄었다고 해서 갑자기 가격을 낮추기 어렵다.</p>\n<p>결국 우리의 노동력을 구매하는 고객들은 수요와 공급에 의해 자연스레 형성되는 적정 가격보다 비싼 가격을 지불하는 것이니, 그만큼 높은 품질의 가치를 지닌 상품들을 선별하게 될 수 밖에 없으며 이 과정에서 해고나 직장을 아예 구하지 못하는 상황과 같은 비자발적 실업이 발생하거나 개발자들의 임금이 양극화 되는 것이다.</p>\n<p>높은 가치의 노동력을 제공하는 판매자는 더 많은 보상을 받지만, 낮은 가치의 노동력을 제공하는 판매자는 아예 구매자가 나타나지 않거나 혹은 기존보다 더 낮은 가격을 제시받는다는 의미이다. <small>(1억원으로 역량이 낮은 인원 3명을 고용하느니, 차라리 역량이 높은 1명을 고용하며 1억원을 몰아주는 것을 선택하기 쉽다는 것이다)</small></p>\n<p>이러한 시장의 변화는 개발자들, 특히 그 중에서도 이제 막 커리어를 시작하려는 분들에게는 굉장히 중요한 포인트이다.</p>\n<p>주식 시장만 보면 마치 경기가 살아나고 있는 것 같지만 아직 해결된 것은 아무것도 없으며, 모두가 힘들고 어려운 시장 상황이다. 필자는 이런 상황에서 “성실하게 노력하면 보상은 자연스레 따라올거야”라는 말을 도저히 할 수 없을 것 같다. 이건 경기가 좋았을 때나 먹히는 말이지 지금은 아니다.</p>\n<p>하지만 이렇게 급변하는 시장 상황 속에서도 TypeScript, React, Next를 공부하면 취업이 잘 된다거나, 요즘에는 Rust가 대세라는 등의 이야기는 많지만 정작 이런 현실적인 이야기를 해주는 사람은 별로 없는 것 같다. 왜 그런지는 잘 모르겠다.</p>\n<p>필자는 물론 기술도 중요하지만 일단 안정적인 삶을 갖춰야 우리가 좋아하는 기술도 즐길 수 있다고 생각한다. 생존을 위한 학습이 아니라 내 지적 만족감이나 호기심 충족을 위한 학습을 하는 것이 스스로에게도 더 건강한 성장이 될테니 말이다.</p>\n<p>필자는 많은 개발자들이 스스로 개발자이기 이전에 한 명의 직장인이고 시장 참여자라는 사실을 잊지 말고, 노동시장을 바라보는 냉철한 시각을 통해 요즘과 같은 어려운 상황에서도 나름의 분석과 대처를 할 수 있는 능력을 갖추길 바란다.</p>\n<p>이상으로 시장에서 살아남는 사람이 되기 포스팅을
