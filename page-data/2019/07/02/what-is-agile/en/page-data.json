My workplace was doing all of that too, but everyone kept asking “what does it actually mean to work in an agile way?” without ever getting a proper answer.</p>\n<p>We started without understanding the essence of agile — just “I tried this a few times and it worked great!” or “another company does this and they improved!” Naturally, things didn’t go smoothly. Estimations were consistently off, sprints kept falling apart, and team morale suffered. So my company, <a href=\"https://soomgo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soomgo</a>, invested a significant amount of money to bring in an agile coach for about a month of training.</p>\n<p>In this post, I’d like to share what I learned from that experience, along with what I noticed after trying various approaches in practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-use-agile\" style=\"position:relative;\">Why Use Agile?<a href=\"#why-use-agile\" aria-label=\"why use agile permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Since so many organizations already use agile, I’ll assume most of you have a general idea of what it is.</p>\n<p>Agile means “nimble” — it’s a development methodology born from the intent to find a balance between having no plan at all and having an overly rigid plan.</p>\n<p>The traditional approach is best represented by the waterfall model.

It’s a process most of us have been through, whether we realized it or not. You set a deadline, and every team member finishes their part and passes it along.

Otherwise, you have to go back to the planners, explain why it’s not feasible, and restart the planning and design process from scratch. At best, it wastes time.

In this post, I’ll focus on the ones I consider most important: User Story, Backlog, Estimation, and Retrospective. Let’s take a quick look at each.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-story\" style=\"position:relative;\">User Story<a href=\"#user-story\" aria-label=\"user story permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Agile is built around user stories. Stories are crucial, and they must be thoroughly <strong>user-centric</strong>. When we typically create stories or issues, they tend to look something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>SD-1234 Revamp the request form page</li>\n<li>SD-1235 Convert the webview-based profile page to native</li>\n<li>SD-1236 Design DB schema and create API endpoints for social login</li>\n<li>SD-1237 Add multi-photo sending feature to user chat</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I received agile coaching, this was the very first thing the coach pointed out. The coach recommended that stories include three elements wherever possible: <strong>Who</strong>, <strong>What</strong>, and <strong>Why</strong>.</p>\n<p>Stories written this way explain, through the title alone, why the team needs to address them. So the stories above should be rewritten like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>SD-1234 A <strong>customer</strong> can see all the information they need at a glance to easily submit a request.</li>\n<li>SD-1235 A <strong>customer</strong> can use the profile page as a native view instead of a webview for a more natural UX.</li>\n<li>SD-1236 A <strong>client developer</strong> can use the relevant API endpoints to build the social login feature.</li>\n<li>SD-1237 A <strong>customer</strong> can use a multi-select feature to easily send multiple photos in a chat.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>User stories written this way can be understood by any team member — even someone completely unrelated to the story — without additional explanation.</p>\n<p>And the user (Who) doesn’t always have to be the customer. In <code class=\"language-text\">SD-1236</code>, the user is the client developer. In cases like this, you still fill in all the information: the client developer (Who) can use the relevant API endpoints (What) to build the social login feature (Why). Team members are both producers and each other’s internal customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"product-backlog\" style=\"position:relative;\">Product Backlog<a href=\"#product-backlog\" aria-label=\"product backlog permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The product backlog consists of multiple user stories that need to be addressed. These stories are sorted by priority as defined by the PO (Product Owner), and prioritization authority rests solely with the PO. A fundamental prerequisite of agile is that team members trust the PO’s decisions.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean blindly following orders — you can freely discuss and voice opinions, but the final call is the PO’s.</p>\n<p>The backlog will keep accumulating stories if left unattended, so the PO needs to periodically review and prune it — deciding which stories are still relevant and which aren’t. Without this maintenance, it takes increasingly longer to sort through and evaluate the backlog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"estimation\" style=\"position:relative;\">Estimation<a href=\"#estimation\" aria-label=\"estimation permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Estimation is the process where team members who will actually work on the stories assess how large each story is by assigning story points.</p>\n<p>A common approach is to use absolute values — if an issue takes 1 hour, it gets 1 story point. My team initially did this too. We decided that 4 hours was a realistic amount of focused work per day, so a task taking about a day was estimated at 4 points.</p>\n<p>The problem was that these estimates were almost always wrong. Unless you’re some kind of savant who can predict exactly when your work will be done, unexpected bugs, surprise meetings, or sick days throw everything off. It happened more often than you’d think, and each time, the sprint would blow up.</p>\n<p>So we switched to <strong>relative</strong> story points. Here’s how it works. You pick a past story as a reference point and have the team estimate it based on their memory of that experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SD-1234 A customer can see all the information they need at a glance to easily submit a request.</strong></p>\n<p>Alice: <em>This one wasn’t that much work, I think. I’d say 3.</em></p>\n<p>Bob: <em>I was doing overtime every day designing this. I’d say 5.</em></p>\n<p>Charlie: <em>I have a crush on Bob, so I’ll say 5 too.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once the team converges on a rough consensus — “redesigning the request form page was about a 5” — you use that as a baseline to relatively measure other stories. You can use T-shirt sizes like <code class=\"language-text\">XS, SM, M, L, XL</code>, or natural numbers like <code class=\"language-text\">1, 2, 3, 4</code>. Since you’re measuring relative size, any abstract scale works.</p>\n<p>For reference, my team uses the Fibonacci sequence: <code class=\"language-text\">1, 2, 3, 5, 8...</code></p>\n<p>Measuring relative size might feel strange at first, but from my experience, it’s more accurate than estimating in hours. The caveat is that you first need to know roughly how many story points your team can handle in a sprint.</p>\n<p>This is figured out by simply running a few sprints. If you completed <code class=\"language-text\">40</code> points in the first sprint and <code class=\"language-text\">20</code> in the second, load about <code class=\"language-text\">30</code> points into the next sprint.</p>\n<p>Even though the second sprint’s completion rate dropped 50% compared to the first, don’t worry!</p>\n<p>Unfinished issues from the second sprint carry over to the third, so the third sprint’s completion rate will be higher than expected. Average it out over a few sprints, and you’ll get a reliable baseline for your team’s velocity.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 493px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/78ff8/dash.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 136.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"dash\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/78ff8/dash.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/0913d/dash.jpg 160w,\n/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/cb69c/dash.jpg 320w,\n/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/78ff8/dash.jpg 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>A bad sprint is likely followed by an overachieving one!</small>\n</center>\n<p>And here’s the important part: the sprint deadline is not a hard deadline.

It should never feel heavy or intimidating!</p>\n<p>At my workplace, we sometimes hold retrospectives at a café near the office over coffee. One method is to draw a timeline, have team members write warm moments and cold moments on sticky notes, place them on the timeline, and vote on topics to discuss. Another is to simply have everyone bring a topic and discuss freely.</p>\n<p>Through the retrospective, the team decides on action items for the next sprint and assigns an owner to each one. Without a designated owner, action items tend to fizzle out.</p>\n<p>The assigned team member periodically reminds others and takes responsibility for completing the action item within the sprint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-is-agile-good\" style=\"position:relative;\">So Is Agile Good?<a href=\"#so-is-agile-good\" aria-label=\"so is agile good permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Personally, I prefer agile — handling small stories and deploying within 1-2 weeks — over the waterfall model with its looming deadlines.

There are awkward gray areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"this-isnt-agile\" style=\"position:relative;\">“This Isn’t Agile!”<a href=\"#this-isnt-agile\" aria-label=\"this isnt agile permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I’ve heard this line quite a few times during daily scrums at work. The situation typically goes like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Something needs to be done. → The issue turns out to be bigger than expected. → There are heavy dependencies between features, so deploying separately is difficult. → Let’s just do it all at once and deploy!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then someone chimes in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hmm, but… that doesn’t seem very agile, does it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And suddenly everyone’s head is spinning. “How do we handle this in an agile way?” Someone asks “so what would the agile approach be?” but nobody has an answer — because the issue simply can’t be broken down into smaller pieces.</p>\n<p>But this isn’t what agile is about. Agile isn’t a rigid set of rules and regulations.</p>\n<p>Sure, there’s the Agile Manifesto and the 12 principles, but those are just guidelines. Every team is different — the idea that a single method works perfectly for every team in the world is absurd.</p>\n<p>I believe in following agile’s basic guidelines while flexibly adapting them to fit each team. You don’t have to follow the manifesto or the principles to the letter. If your team comes up with some creative approach that works for them, that’s perfectly fine. We’re all just trying to work well together — there’s no reason to create rigid rules for the sake of it. Just get the work done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dont-get-too-hung-up-on-agile\" style=\"position:relative;\">Don’t Get Too Hung Up on Agile<a href=\"#dont-get-too-hung-up-on-agile\" aria-label=\"dont get too hung up on agile permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>When I first heard the Agile Manifesto, I’ll be honest — it reminded me of communism.</p>\n<p>When Marx first proposed Marxism and wrote <em>Das Kapital</em>, the prevailing sentiment among workers was that communism was the perfect system, that it would keep evolving while capitalism would eventually collapse on its own. But communism in practice hit the wall of reality, mutating into Stalinism, Maoism, and other variants that mostly ended in dictatorship.</p>\n<p>What started as “let’s all prosper together” became “let’s all be poor together” once it met the real world.</p>\n<p>Similarly, agile in practice doesn’t always run as smoothly as the theory suggests. The situation I described above is one of many awkward scenarios. What do you do when an issue can’t be broken down and won’t fit within a single sprint?</p>\n<p>The Agile Manifesto says all the right things, but obsessing over it can turn your organization into one that creates work for the sake of work.</p>\n<p>Consider the capitalism we enjoy today. If it had stayed as Adam Smith originally envisioned — “leave the market alone and it’ll sort itself out” — it probably would have collapsed. But by incorporating good ideas from socialism through policies like the New Deal — nationalization programs, welfare policies — capitalism evolved and survived. Nothing is absolutely perfect.</p>\n<p>Likewise, whether it’s agile, waterfall, kanban, or whatever else — I think all that matters is working efficiently. So I took the Agile Manifesto in one ear and let it out the other. Mix and match whatever looks good, and if it works for your team, that’s all that counts. The manifesto says such obvious things that it didn’t feel worth memorizing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>What I took away from the agile coaching was the ironic realization that “there’s no right answer in agile” — and simultaneously, “wait, so does that mean as long as you can ship products nimbly, the manifesto and everything else doesn’t actually matter?”</p>\n<p>I still believe that agile is simply about delivering products to customers nimbly — whether your sprints are one week or two, however you do estimation, whatever your method. It doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>That said, if your team is looking to adopt agile, I think it’s worth doing it properly, which is why I’m sharing what I learned from our coaching experience. Having the team come together, try different approaches, reflect on what worked through retrospectives, and discuss how to improve — that’s an experience that’s genuinely hard to come by. It’s actually really fun, I promise.</p>\n<p>Agile, done right, requires a surprising amount of study. There’s a lot to learn, and you need the ability to adapt and evaluate these concepts for your specific team. But from what I’ve experienced firsthand and heard from developers at other organizations, many teams that claim to practice agile are simply running sprints, holding daily scrum meetings, and using JIRA — and calling that agile.</p>\n<p>Without knowing how many story points your team can realistically handle per sprint, or checking whether your external and internal customers are actually satisfied — agile without this kind of continuous inspection is nothing more than repeating 1-2 week deadlines. I’ve been there, and trust me, it’s miserable. The constant pressure of deadlines every single week… ugh.</p>\n<p>I hope that as you develop an interest in agile, you’ll also bring a passion for collaboration — and that you can have fun while working with your team.</p>\n<p>That wraps up this post on what agile even

너무 체계적인 계획이 있는 개발 방법론 사이의 균형을 잡아보자는 의도로 나온 개발 방법론이다.</p>\n<p>전통적인 개발 방법론으로는 폭포수 모델(Waterfall)이 대표적인데, 이 개발 방법론의 특징은 바로 앞만 보고 달리되, 굉장히 긍정적인 마인드를 품은 개발 방법론이라는 것이다.</p>\n<p>폭포수 모델을 포함한 이런 전통적인 개발 방법론들은 대략 다음과 같은 큰 틀을 가진다</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>기획 > 디자인 > 개발 > 테스트 > 배포 > 유지보수</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>굉장히 익숙하지 않은가? 우리도 알게 모르게 여러 번 겪었을 프로세스다. 이 프로세스는 마감 기한을 정해놓고 그 마감 기한 안에 프로젝트를 끝내기 위해 모든 팀원이 자신이 맡은 일을 끝낸 후 다음 차례로 넘긴다. 이렇게 아무 문제 없이 끝난다면 모두가 행복한 해피엔딩이겠지만 현실은 그렇지 않다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:

따른다.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>우리의 최우선 순위는 가치 있는 소프트웨어를 일찍 그리고 지속적으로 전달해서 고객을 만족시키는 것이다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>비록 개발의 후반부일지라도 요구사항 변경을 환영하라. 애자일 프로세스들은 변화를 활용해 고객의 경쟁력에 도움이 되게 한다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>작동하는 소프트웨어를 자주 전달하라. 두어 주에서 두어 개월의 간격으로 하되 더 짧은 기간을 선호하라.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>비즈니스 쪽의 사람들과 개발자들은 프로젝트 전체에 걸쳐 날마다 함께 일해야 한다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>동기가 부여된 개인들 중심으로 프로젝트를 구성하라. 그들이 필요로 하는 환경과 지원을 주고 그들이 일을 끝내리라고 신뢰하라.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>개발팀으로, 또 개발팀 내부에서 정보를 전하는 가장 효율적이고 효과적인 방법은 면대면 대화이다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>작동하는 소프트웨어가 진척의 주된 척도이다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>애자일 프로세스들은 지속 가능한 개발을 장려한다. 스폰서, 개발자, 사용자는 일정한 속도를 계속 유지할 수 있어야 한다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>기술적 탁월성과 좋은 설계에 대한 지속적 관심이 기민함을 높인다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>안 하는 일의 양을 최대화하는 기술이 필수적이다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>최고의 아키텍처, 요구사항, 설계는 자기 조직적인 팀에서 창발한다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>팀은 정기적으로 어떻게 더 효과적이 될지 숙고하고, 이에 따라 팀의 행동을 조율하고 조정한다.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>애자일 선언 이면의 원칙</strong> <em><a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/ko/manifesto.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">agilemanifesto.org</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>우리가 애자일 프로세스라고 하면 떠올리는 몇가지 일들은 이 12개의 원칙을 기반으로 생겨난 것이다.</p>\n<p>예를 들면 스프린트(Sprint)는 3번 원칙에 기초하며 매 스프린트가 끝날 때마다 행하는 회고(Retrospective)는 12번 원칙에 기초한다.</p>\n<p>또한 애자일에서는 거대한 팀보다는 일명 Task Force Team(TF Team)을 선호하는데, 이건 5번에서 기초한다. 그 이유는 거대한 팀보다 작은 팀이 더 유기적으로 움직이기 편하기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>이 12개의 원칙은 어떻게 하면 더 기민하게 프로덕트를 생산하고 고객에게 전달할 수 있는지에 대한 일종의 가이드라인 역할을 하는 셈이다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"애자일의-기본적인-요소들\" style=\"position:relative;\">애자일의 기본적인 요소들<a

때문에 그냥 에스티메이션이라고 하겠다.</p>\n<p>에스티메이션은 PO가 만들어놓은 여러 가지 스토리를 가져와서 실제 그 스토리를 해결할 팀원들이 이 이슈가 어느 정도의 크기를 가진 이슈인지 스토리 포인트를 매기는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이때 많이 하는 방법이 이슈를 처리하는데 걸리는 시간이 1시간이라면 스토리 포인트 1점으로 계산하여 절대값으로 매기는데, 필자의 직장도 처음에는 이렇게 생각하고 하루에 집중해서 일할 수 있는 시간을 4시간으로 정한 후 처리하는데 하루 정도 걸리는 이슈는 4점으로 에스티메이션하는 방법을 사용했다.</p>\n<p>근데 문제는 이 예상이 거의 대부분 빗나간다는 것이다. 물론 자기가 하는 일이 정확히 언제 끝날 지 산정하실 수 있는 굇수분들도 있겠지만 필자와 필자의 팀원들은 그냥 일반인이기 때문에 그러지 못했다. 예상하지 못한 버그가 터지거나 예상하지 못한 회의가 생겼다거나 혹은 갑자기 아파서 병가를 썼다거나 이런 예외 상황은 생각보다 자주 발생했고 그럴때마다 스프린트도 펑펑 터져나갔다.</p>\n<p>그래서 택한 방법은 바로 스토리 포인트를 <strong>상대값</strong> 으로 매기는 것이다. 방법은 이렇다. 과거에 지나갔던 스토리 중에 기준이 될만한 스토리를 하나 가져와서 그 스토리에 대해서 팀원들이 그때의 경험을 토대로 에스티메이션을 한다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SD-1234 사용자는 요청서를 쉽게 보내기 위해 필요한 정보를 한눈에 확인할 수 있다.</strong></p>\n<p>철수: <em>이거 생각보다 일이 없었던 것 같은데? 저는 3.</em></p>\n<p>영희: <em>이거 디자인하느라 맨날 야근했어. 나는 5.</em></p>\n<p>민철: <em>난 영희를 좋아하니까 나도 5.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>이런 식으로 어느 정도 팀원들의 의견이 수렴이 되면 “요청서 페이지의 디자인을 바꿨던 스토리가 5정도 된다”라는 기준을 잡을 수 있다. 이제 이 스토리를 기준으로 다른 스토리들의 크기를 상대적으로 측정해나가는 것이다. 측정하는 스토리 포인트는 <code class=\"language-text\">XS, SM, M, L, XL</code>와 같이 티셔츠 사이즈로 하는 방법도 있고 <code class=\"language-text\">1, 2, 3, 4</code>와 같은 자연수를 사용해도 상관없다. 어차피 상대적인 크기를 측정하는 것이므로 추상적인 크기만 설정할 수 있으면 된다.</p>\n<p>참고로 필자의 회사는 <code class=\"language-text\">1, 2, 3, 5, 8...</code>의 피보나치 수열을 사용하고 있다.</p>\n<p>처음에는 상대적인 크기를 측정한다는 것이 어렵게 느껴질 지 모르지만 필자가 경험해본 느낌으로는 시간을 측정하는 것보단 이 방법이 더 정확했다. 단, 팀이 한 스프린트에 어느 정도의 스토리 포인트를 쳐낼 수 있는지에 대한 정보가 먼저 필요하다.</p>\n<p>이건 그냥 적당히 몇번 돌려보면 각이 나온다. 첫번째 스프린트에 <code class=\"language-text\">40</code>, 두번째 스프린트에는 <code class=\"language-text\">20</code>을 쳤다면 다음 스프린트에는 평균 값인 <code class=\"language-text\">30</code>만큼의 스토리만 넣는 것이다.</p>\n<p>비록 첫번째 스프린트에 비해 두번째 스프린트는 달성률이 50%나 떨어졌지만 걱정하지말자!</p>\n<p>두번째 스프린트에 끝내지 못한 이슈는 세번째 스프린트까지 이어진 후 그 스프린트 안에 끝나기 때문에 다음 스프린트의 달성률은 원래 예상치보다 더 높아지므로 세 스프린트의 평균을 내보면 비슷한 값이 나온다. 그런 식으로 몇번 스프린트를 돌려보면 한번의 스프린트가 도는 동안 팀이 평균적으로 몇 만큼의 스토리 포인트를 쳐낼 수 있는지 각이 나온다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span

생각보다 공부가 굉장히 많이 필요한 개발 방법론이다. 알아야 할 것도 많고 이것들을 각자의 팀에 맞게 응용하고 점검할 수 있는 능력도 있어야 한다.\n그러나 필자가 직접 다른 조직에서 경험하거나 근처 개발자들한테 주워들은 얘기를 빌자면, 애자일을 도입한 많은 조직들이 단순히 스프린트를 돌리고 데일리 스크럼 미팅을 하고 JIRA를 사용하기만 하면서 애자일을 한다고 하는 경우도 많이 있다.</p>\n<p>우리 팀이 스프린트에 쳐낼 수 있는 스토리 포인트가 어느 정도인지, 또 우리가 애자일을 하면서 외부 고객과 내부 고객들이 만족하고 있는지, 이런 끊임없는 점검이 부재한 애자일은 그냥 1-2주 단위의 데드라인을 반복할 뿐이다. 이거 해봐서 아는데 진짜 죽을 맛이다. 매일 데드라인의 압박을 느낀다는 건…후</p>\n<p>이 글을 읽는 여러분이 애자일에 관심을 가짐과 동시에 협업에 대한 열정도 뿜뿜하면서 팀에서 재밌고 즐겁게 일할 수 있기를 바란다.</p>\n<p>이상으로 애자일이 도대체 뭐길래? 포스팅을 마친다.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190702-what-is-agile","path":"/2019/07/02/what-is-agile/","lang":"ko"},"frontmatter":{"title":"애자일이 도대체 뭐길래?","subTitle":"애자일을 도입했지만 제대로 굴러가지 않는 조직을 위해","date":"Jul 02,
