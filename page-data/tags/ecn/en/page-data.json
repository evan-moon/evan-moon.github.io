In contrast, lower-layer protocols like TCP, UDP, and IP are ones we encounter far less often.</p>\n<p>That’s because the OS handles most of these for us. Developers programming at higher layers don’t need to worry about every detail of what happens down below.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons the layered model exists in the first place. Networking is a convergence of countless technologies, and no single developer can know everything. Through strict separation of responsibilities between layers, the scope of what you need to worry about for any given task is narrowed down.</p>\n<p>Thanks to this, when using HTTP, we don’t need to simultaneously think about which DNS server to use or how to process packets.</p>\n<p>That said, even with these clear layer boundaries, if you have zero knowledge of what happens in the lower layers, you might encounter situations where everything looks fine at the application layer but a lower-layer issue leaves you completely helpless.</p>\n<p>For this reason, I think it’s worth knowing at least the general workings and overview of the protocols you use.

If A then wanted to talk to C instead, you’d unplug the cable from B’s jack and plug it into C’s.</p>\n<p>With circuit switching, you physically hold one dedicated line for communicating with your counterpart, which means circuit utilization is inherently low. It’s the same principle as getting a “the person you’re calling is currently on another call” message when you try to phone someone.</p>\n<p>Of course, monopolizing a circuit has advantages — like being able to stream large amounts of data at high speed. But what mattered to the U.S. at the time was a connection that wouldn’t break even if a nuke went off, so depending entirely on a single circuit was a major drawback.</p>\n<p>This led to the idea of packet switching. Instead of sending data through a single circuit — where a destroyed line or relay station means losing the data forever — the idea was to split data into small pieces and send them through multiple circuits. A kind of diversified investment, if you will.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/200a4648f12fe0e8e32c2a9308df4465/0d98f/packets.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 29.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"packets\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/200a4648f12fe0e8e32c2a9308df4465/6af66/packets.png\" srcset=\"/static/200a4648f12fe0e8e32c2a9308df4465/69538/packets.png 160w,\n/static/200a4648f12fe0e8e32c2a9308df4465/72799/packets.png 320w,\n/static/200a4648f12fe0e8e32c2a9308df4465/6af66/packets.png 640w,\n/static/200a4648f12fe0e8e32c2a9308df4465/d9199/packets.png 960w,\n/static/200a4648f12fe0e8e32c2a9308df4465/0d98f/packets.png 1276w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This way, even if one node is destroyed, not all data is lost</small>\n</center>\n<p>In the worst case, a destroyed circuit or relay station might cause some data loss, but as long as the entire network isn’t hit at once, the chance of losing all data is low.

Since the sequence number increments by 1 per byte, the first byte chunk gets 0, the second gets 1, the third gets 2, and so on.</p>\n<p>So in this transmission, the receiver received 100 byte chunks numbered 0 through 99, and the sequence number it should expect in the next transmission is not 2, but 100.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/05244/ack.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 27.500000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ack\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/6af66/ack.png\" srcset=\"/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/69538/ack.png 160w,\n/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/72799/ack.png 320w,\n/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/6af66/ack.png 640w,\n/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/d9199/ack.png 960w,\n/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/21b4d/ack.png 1280w,\n/static/4c5dc85683ae837d23500d773f219316/05244/ack.png 1752w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>100 bytes are bundled into a single segment for transmission</small>\n</center>\n<p>If you capture packets using <code class=\"language-text\">tcpdump</code>, you can actually see the receiver’s acknowledgment number increasing by the length of data the sender transmitted.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-bash\">localhost.http-alt <span class=\"token operator\">></span> localhost.49680: Flags <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>P.<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>, <span class=\"token function\">seq</span> <span class=\"token number\">160</span>:240, ack <span class=\"token number\">161</span>, win <span class=\"token number\">6374</span>, length <span class=\"token number\">80</span>\nlocalhost.49680 <span class=\"token operator\">></span> localhost.http-alt: Flags <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>.<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>, ack <span class=\"token number\">240</span>, win <span class=\"token number\">6374</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Looking at the sender’s segment, the sequence number shows <code class=\"language-text\">seq 160:240</code>, and the receiver uses the value after the colon as its acknowledgment number.</p>\n<p>Here, the sequence number format represents a range of <code class=\"language-text\">n inclusive : m exclusive</code>.

Data pointed to by this pointer is given high priority and processed first. Rarely used today.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ACK</td>\n<td>Indicates that the Acknowledgment Number field contains a valid value. If this flag is 0, the acknowledgment number field is ignored entirely.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PSH</td>\n<td>Push flag. Requests that the receiver deliver this data to the application as quickly as possible. If this flag is 0, the receiver waits until its buffer is full. When this flag is 1, it also implies there are no more segments connected after this one.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RST</td>\n<td>Reset flag. A request to forcefully reset the connection with a counterpart that is already in <code class=\"language-text\">ESTABLISHED</code> state.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SYN</td>\n<td>Synchronize flag. Indicates this segment is for synchronizing sequence numbers when establishing a connection with the other party.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FIN</td>\n<td>Finish flag. Indicates this segment is a request to terminate the connection with the other party.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The newly added <code class=\"language-text\">NS</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">CWR</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">ECE</code> flags (carved out of the former Reserved field) are used for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).</p>\n<p>Before ECN, the conventional method for detecting network congestion relied on timeouts. But for latency-sensitive applications, even that waiting time was too costly, so a special mechanism was needed to explicitly notify senders and receivers of congestion — and that’s ECN.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">CWR</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">ECE</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">ECT</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">CE</code> flags are used to inform the other party about congestion.

The method is simple, but since looking at 16-bit additions would make the numbers painfully long, let me demonstrate with a simpler 8-bit example.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">  11010101\n+ 10110100\n-----------\n 110001001</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Oops — adding two 8-bit numbers produced a 9-bit result with an extra digit. This overflow can’t fit in the checksum field.</p>\n<p>This extra digit that appears when adding two numbers is called a carry. Just take that carry bit, detach it from the result, and add it back:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">  10001001\n+        1 (the overflowed bit)\n-----------\n  10001010</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This technique is called wrap-around. Now take the one’s complement of the final result, and you have the checksum. “One’s complement” might sound fancy, but it just means flipping all the bits.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">10001010\n01110101 (after taking one's complement)</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Now <code class=\"language-text\">01110101</code> is the checksum for this data. In this example I used 8 bits, so an 8-bit checksum came out. In practice, the data is split into 16-bit chunks for this process, producing a value that fits perfectly into the 16-bit checksum field.</p>\n<p>The receiver, upon receiving the data, goes through the same process but stops before taking the one’s complement — at the value <code class=\"language-text\">10001010</code>. It then adds this value to the checksum sent by the sender. If all bits are 1, the data is considered valid.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">  10001010\n+ 01110101\n-----------\n  11111111</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>If even a single bit is 0, it indicates that something was altered in the data the sender transmitted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"urgent-pointer\" style=\"position:relative;\">Urgent Pointer<a href=\"#urgent-pointer\" aria-label=\"urgent pointer permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/c7bb6/header-urgent.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 33.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"header urgent\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/6af66/header-urgent.png\" srcset=\"/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/69538/header-urgent.png 160w,\n/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/72799/header-urgent.png 320w,\n/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/6af66/header-urgent.png 640w,\n/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/d9199/header-urgent.png 960w,\n/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/21b4d/header-urgent.png 1280w,\n/static/555aeadb010efbf3bcfcac8043546218/c7bb6/header-urgent.png 1986w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>As the name suggests, this is an urgent pointer.

Admittedly, this only scratches the surface of TCP, but given that this is a nearly 50-year-old protocol, there’s far too much content to fit into a single post.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned at the start, protocols like TCP and IP are ones you rarely interact with directly unless you’re doing socket programming.</p>\n<p>But even without direct interaction, as a web developer who uses HTTP every day, I think it’s worth knowing how the protocols underlying your daily work actually operate.</p>\n<p>If you want to see how TCP is implemented in the kernel, you can check out the implementations in <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/net/ipv4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">linux/net/ipv4</a> in the Linux source on GitHub. (Fair warning — the Linux source itself is so massive that cloning it takes ages.)</p>\n<p>If you’d like to observe TCP communication firsthand, you can use a simple <a href=\"https://github.com/evan-moon/simple-tcp-example\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TCP example program</a> along with utilities like <code class=\"language-text\">tcpdump</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">netstat</code>. Use <code class=\"language-text\">tcpdump</code> to inspect the content of packets exchanged between client and server, and <code class=\"language-text\">netstat</code> to check the TCP states of the client and server.</p>\n<p>In the next post, I’ll cover TCP’s handshake process, flow control, and congestion control mechanisms.</p>\n<p>That concludes this post on what information is stored in TCP’s header.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20191110-header-of-tcp-en","path":"/2019/11/10/header-of-tcp/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Information Is Stored in TCP's Header?","subTitle":"From packet switching to checksums — everything about the TCP header","date":"Nov 10, 2019","categories":["Programming","Network"],"tags":["TCP","Header","ECN","TCP Flags","SYN","ACK","TCP Header","Packet Switching","TCP Checksum"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/d803c/thumbnail.png","srcSet":"/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/d803c/thumbnail.png 320w,\n/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/2a1fd/thumbnail.png 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/fc5c5/thumbnail.webp 320w,\n/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/e9225/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/01fb2/thumbnail.png","srcSet":"/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/01fb2/thumbnail.png 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/08849868fcdd6a15a88abb391dccacf7/b384d/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"ECN","lang":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3523904809","650499039"],"slicesMap":{}}
