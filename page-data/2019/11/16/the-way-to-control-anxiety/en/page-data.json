I became a developer because I loved building things so much, yet I’d spent a whole month not building anything.</p>\n<p>My past month was a continuous series of studying fundamentals, a review period examining things I’d missed until now. But I don’t think I enjoyed studying. No, actually it’s more accurate to say I had no intention of enjoying the studying.</p>\n<p>As my thoughts reached this point, I suddenly felt disillusionment and decided to stop studying briefly and take time to reflect on myself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-was-anxious\" style=\"position:relative;\">I Was Anxious<a href=\"#i-was-anxious\" aria-label=\"i was anxious permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Over the past month, I was being chased by reality. The mindset I’d resolved in Prague — “live with leisure” — disappeared completely a few weeks after arriving in Seoul.</p>\n<p>Actually, the fundamental cause of this uncomfortable emotion is anxiety. This anxiety turned my daily life black and white. When meeting friends, the moments were enjoyable, but whenever there was a gap, thoughts appeared that I should hurry home and immediately open books and laptop to study.</p>\n<p>Just looking at it, this isn’t a healthy mental state. Sure, I pretend otherwise on the outside, but inside I’m rotting. So I stopped studying briefly and started thinking about exactly what was making me so anxious and chased.</p>\n<p>Of course, a big reason is that after bombing an interview for the first time in a while, I faced my weaknesses raw. But feeling this anxious just because of this seemed a bit strange. Honestly, this wasn’t my first or second time bombing interviews.</p>\n<p>After thinking deeply for about a day, several anxiety factors became organized. After that, I listed these factors and started examining them one by one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-gap-between-reality-and-ideals\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Gap Between Reality and Ideals<a href=\"#the-gap-between-reality-and-ideals\" aria-label=\"the gap between reality and ideals permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>When I was young, the saying from parents and adults I understood least was “you can’t live doing only what you want to do.” <small>(Of course, this is always followed by “study”)</small></p>\n<p>As time passed, after returning from military service and returning to college, I gradually came to understand what those adults meant. Since not everything in the world goes my way, it was a teaching to let go of my heart to some degree.</p>\n<p>Even on days I desperately didn’t want to study, I had to pull all-nighters studying for scholarships. I didn’t want to go to the military, but due to national defense duty I rolled around for 23 months. After these experiences, I thought “ah, so that’s what they meant.”</p>\n<p>Still, I didn’t want to live my whole life forcing myself to do unwanted work just for money, so for my life’s happiness I set “work I want to do” as my highest priority. Fortunately, by becoming a developer, I could live a life of perfect alignment — securing a place as a member of society, stable income as an office worker, and work I could enjoy doing.</p>\n<p>But contrary to my thought that working as a developer would only bring happiness, life as a developer was fierce. Competition was no longer for test rankings or scholarships — real competition for survival had begun.</p>\n<p>Though problems like gender discrimination and educational discrimination still exist, fundamentally 2019 Korea is a society trying to give everyone equal opportunity. Such opportunities can usually be grabbed through individual ability or skills.</p>\n<p>Among these, developers — representative professionals in the IT industry — are particularly skill-focused, truly living by pure ability. To avoid becoming obsolete, you must constantly study, keeping up with rapidly changing tech trends and paradigms. That’s why developers share self-deprecating jokes that they must keep studying until they open a chicken restaurant.</p>\n<p>Still, studying programming itself was so fun and good for me. I chose work I wanted to do anyway, and the more I studied, the better structure and performance my applications could have.</p>\n<p>But as mentioned earlier, over the recent month studying computer science fundamentals, I wasn’t purely enjoying it.</p>\n<p>Actually, what puzzled me most about not enjoying this studying was that the process of studying fundamentals was an experience I’d already gone through in college, yet the emotions I felt then versus now are so different. Back then, studying the same content felt fascinating and extremely fun.</p>\n<p>So why were these topics that were so fun in college not fun anymore now?</p>\n<p>The reason is study motivation. As I mentioned once in the <a href=\"/2019/08/26/how-does-developer-study/\">How Developers Survive Through Study</a> post, actually, studying requires healthy motivation more than topic difficulty.</p>\n<p>But currently I’m not voluntarily studying computer science fundamentals — I’m being pushed by the external situation of job hunting to study. To put it more simply, I’m not studying topics I want according to need — I’m forcing myself to study things I don’t currently want to do because of external circumstances.</p>\n<center>\n  <div style=\"width: 300px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/1207b2871c1ea2db64733f985a5a49b8/80e3c/study-motivation.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 118.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"study motivation\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/1207b2871c1ea2db64733f985a5a49b8/c08c5/study-motivation.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/1207b2871c1ea2db64733f985a5a49b8/0913d/study-motivation.jpg 160w,\n/static/1207b2871c1ea2db64733f985a5a49b8/cb69c/study-motivation.jpg 320w,\n/static/1207b2871c1ea2db64733f985a5a49b8/c08c5/study-motivation.jpg 640w,\n/static/1207b2871c1ea2db64733f985a5a49b8/80e3c/study-motivation.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <small>Like when mom tells you to study now, you suddenly don't want to even though you'd study later anyway</small>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>Actually, when choosing study topics, I should feel excited thinking “how will studying this make me better?” But over the recent month, I chose topics thinking “will they ask this in interviews?” — of course it wouldn’t be fun.</p>\n<p>Still, just like adults said you can’t live doing only what you want, it’s also clearly true that I need to fill my gaps to pass interviews.</p>\n<p>I chose the developer profession because I wanted to work enjoyably, but I was starting to feel dissonance and discomfort about this situation where I’m studying unenjoyably due to realistic circumstances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disappointment-in-myself\" style=\"position:relative;\">Disappointment in Myself<a href=\"#disappointment-in-myself\" aria-label=\"disappointment in myself permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Actually, until now I’d chosen companies without much thought. I just needed to work enjoyably — where I worked didn’t seem that important.</p>\n<p>Choosing workplaces that way naturally led me to mostly work at small-scale startups where I could receive more authority and do more work myself.</p>\n<p>But recently, many developer friends advised me to “experience small places and big places too.” Meaning to experience more variety and grow. For that reason, this time I’m targeting places slightly larger than workplaces I’ve worked at until now.</p>\n<p>But big companies have hiring processes and desired talent profiles somewhat different from the scale of companies I’ve worked at until now.</p>\n<p>Small-scale startups literally need developers who can work right now like one-person armies. With mountains of products to build but always scarce resources, each person has no choice but to play many roles. Plus, with scarce resources, there’s often relatively less leisure for systematically educating someone or self-learning compared to big companies.</p>\n<p>In contrast, big companies aren’t urgently seeking developers who can work immediately upon joining. Sure, any company would like more developer resources if possible, so they keep hiring. But compared to small-scale startups, they’re probably not struggling desperately needing people who can work right now.</p>\n<p>Plus, since system scale can also increase proportionally to development team scale, systems at companies already holding many developers are often vast in size and complex in structure.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the bigger the scale, the more they focus on “do you really properly understand this?” rather than asking if you’re familiar with a specific framework. That’s why they ask deeply about computer science or language fundamentals.</p>\n<p>I naturally knew these facts, but honestly until my first interview after returning to Korea, I wasn’t particularly worried. My mindset was probably just “I’ll work there if I pass, otherwise I’ll go somewhere else.” Actually, right after failing my first interview, my mental state wasn’t impacted — no anxiety or anything.</p>\n<p>Still, since I failed the interview, I could know what I currently lack, and naturally I wanted to complement this part. But strangely, the more I studied, the more my heart started feeling unsettled.</p>\n<p>I recently saw a meme on SNS about psychological changes in guys after breaking up with girlfriends. Right after breaking up, they feel relieved and free, but as time passes longing grows and they regret. Kind of that feeling.</p>\n<p>The more I studied, the more situations where I couldn’t properly answer in the interview kept surfacing, and belated shame and regret rushed in. Simultaneously, disappointment in myself started appearing.</p>\n<p>Honestly speaking, I thought I knew about computer science reasonably well. I’d already learned this content once in school, and I’d accumulated knowledge analyzing various things. But reality was different.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/32fed26596b7dca5ba59de968d154e49/f537d/snl.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 54.37499999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"snl\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/32fed26596b7dca5ba59de968d154e49/c08c5/snl.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/32fed26596b7dca5ba59de968d154e49/0913d/snl.jpg 160w,\n/static/32fed26596b7dca5ba59de968d154e49/cb69c/snl.jpg 320w,\n/static/32fed26596b7dca5ba59de968d154e49/c08c5/snl.jpg 640w,\n/static/32fed26596b7dca5ba59de968d154e49/f537d/snl.jpg 854w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>Once I entered the interview room and heard questions like “explain GC,” my mind went blank.

In other words, I didn’t properly understand.</p>\n<p>After experiencing this a few times, I realized the knowledge I thought I knew actually wasn’t properly understood. Thoughts crept in that maybe I’d been studying uselessly all along, anxiety that I might be falling behind other developers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"being-recognized-feels-burdensome\" style=\"position:relative;\">Being Recognized Feels Burdensome<a href=\"#being-recognized-feels-burdensome\" aria-label=\"being recognized feels burdensome permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Ironically, this very blog I’m writing on now is also one factor in my anxiety. More precisely, it’s a factor that lit fire to my unstable psychological state and amplified anxiety.</p>\n<p>Until now, I’ve shared posts through some promotion to share my knowledge and thoughts with others. As a result, people who enjoyed reading my posts started saying things like “I enjoyed reading your post” or “thanks for sharing good information.” Until then, I just felt good that my knowledge could help others.</p>\n<p>But recently, after experiencing people recognizing me offline a few times, some burden started creeping in. <small>(I really never imagined this would happen)</small></p>\n<p>This emotion amplifies most when interviewers say “I regularly read your blog” — the embarrassment and burden then are indescribable. It’s a magic phrase that makes me suddenly tense even when I wasn’t tense before.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean being recognized itself feels burdensome. The problem is that as people started recognizing me, I gradually started caring about others’ gazes.</p>\n<p>Actually, I write blog posts to share my knowledge with others, but fundamentally the bigger purpose is organizing what I studied. Through the process of organizing my knowledge in writing, I expect effects of increasing study efficiency and lasting longer in memory.</p>\n<p>But unless I have tremendous memory, no matter how many times I study content, if I don’t actually use that knowledge and long time passes, it naturally gets forgotten from memory. Ultimately, regardless of what, study’s basics are repetitive learning. Just writing one post doesn’t make that knowledge wholly mine.</p>\n<p>For that reason, I keep reading posts I wrote in the past, ruminating.</p>\n<p>But from the reader’s perspective, they might think the person who wrote the post completely understands this knowledge. Even I, when reading other developers’ blog posts, vaguely equated people who write good blog posts with people with good skills. Because I thought they write so well precisely because they know this content inside-out.</p>\n<p>But writing well and organizing well doesn’t mean my programming skills are good. My actual ability might not be as satisfying as what readers think and expect.</p>\n<p>The burden I feel originated from these situations. The moment someone says “Evan, about that content you organized back then~,” I think “what if I can’t answer this?” Especially if that person is an interviewer.</p>\n<p>Also, occasionally people say excessive things like “master” or “respect.” But I’m neither a master nor someone worthy of respect — just a tiny 4-year developer. So while grateful, I felt some burden.</p>\n<p>So whenever experiencing these situations, these thoughts started appearing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>My actual skill is only about 3, but what if people think my skill is 6 or 7?</li>\n<li>What if I can’t properly answer questions about posts I wrote?</li>\n<li>I’m not someone worthy of respect or a master… do I deserve hearing these words…?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For that reason, at some point, obsessive thinking that I must create a shell of “me as people think” started creeping in. Amidst all this, bombing the interview amplified this anxiety together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ultimately-its-a-mindset-problem\" style=\"position:relative;\">Ultimately It’s a Mindset Problem<a href=\"#ultimately-its-a-mindset-problem\" aria-label=\"ultimately its a mindset problem permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Actually, these anxious feelings are feelings that can naturally arise in people. But since these emotions are vague feelings like “I’m anxious,” we don’t usually think clearly to the point of “I’m anxious because of what exactly.”</p>\n<p>But if you can’t clearly identify why you’re anxious, you can’t solve that problem. So I listed out anxiety’s causes and faced these problems head-on.</p>\n<p>While organizing and listing anxiety factors’ causes, I naturally went through a process of asking and answering myself about these problems, defining my own solutions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"get-clear-motivation\" style=\"position:relative;\">Get Clear Motivation<a href=\"#get-clear-motivation\" aria-label=\"get clear motivation permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the reason I felt studying computer science fundamentals was unenjoyable is the mindset of having to do it even if I don’t want to. Of course, realistically speaking, that’s not wrong. I need to complement my weaknesses to pass interviews.</p>\n<p>But if I’m not studying just this once, this kind of motivation is no good. Motivation by external pressure can drive yourself and grow quickly for a moment, but it actually becomes an obstacle to continuous growth.</p>\n<p>Actually, thinking fundamentally, the content I studied as a college student versus now isn’t hugely different. But the reason why fundamental study was fun then but not now lies exactly here.</p>\n<p>Back then, the fact that I could grow by studying this became motivation. But now, the fact that I must pass interviews became motivation. So even studying the same thing, I couldn’t help receiving quite different feelings.</p>\n<p>So I’m trying to return to my initial mindset and focus on growth itself. Though the start of intense fundamental study might have been because of interviews, ultimately it’s also a good opportunity for me to grow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interviews-are-just-interviews\" style=\"position:relative;\">Interviews Are Just Interviews<a href=\"#interviews-are-just-interviews\" aria-label=\"interviews are just interviews permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Actually, grasping a person’s capabilities wholly during just one or two hours of short interview time is itself extremely difficult.</p>\n<p>That’s why most companies divide interview stages like 1st technical, 2nd executive to evaluate. But even doing this, since computer science as a field is too broad, truly grasping all that person’s strengths and weaknesses is nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>But neither companies nor job seekers can stick together for days just for one interview, so they try to evaluate job seekers through methods or questions that can objectively and efficiently assess skills in the shortest time possible.</p>\n<p>Naturally companies also know this fact, so interviewers prepare somewhat objective questions either on their own or according to company guidelines. But how much these questions can extract job seekers’ strengths or weaknesses — nobody knows.</p>\n<p>In other words, interview evaluation results inevitably carry some one-sidedness.</p>\n<p>But during the interview process, when job seekers can’t answer questions interviewers asked, the fact that those questions did pierce job seekers’ weaknesses is of course true. That’s why I organized and studied content I couldn’t answer.</p>\n<p>But having weaknesses doesn’t mean being incompetent and terrible. Weaknesses can be complemented. Interviews aren’t like college entrance exams taken only once per year, so just try again at the next opportunity.</p>\n<p>Borrowing my vocal teacher’s words, rather you should be grateful you can discover your weaknesses through such opportunities. Without even these opportunities, it would actually be harder to grow.</p>\n<p>Some might think this is just mental victory, but only by maintaining healthy mindset can you make continuous attempts. So I think this kind of mental care helps personal growth and development.</p>\n<p>What’s important isn’t failing interviews, but discovering your weaknesses through interviews and securing driving force for continuous study through proper motivation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"just-keep-writing-blog-consistently\" style=\"position:relative;\">Just Keep Writing Blog Consistently<a href=\"#just-keep-writing-blog-consistently\" aria-label=\"just keep writing blog consistently permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I’m not someone who gives myself generous evaluations to begin with. This is just my inherent personality, so even as a human being, not just as a developer. So I couldn’t accept well the words people who read my posts gave as praise and encouragement. <small>(I’m the type who doesn’t accept compliments well)</small></p>\n<p>Actually, I reached conclusions thinking alone about the two previous cases, but I haven’t reached a clear conclusion just for this problem yet. I did hear advice to just listen and let it pass since everyone means well with no big meaning, but given my personality that’s not easy either.</p>\n<p>But will I stop writing blogs then? That’s not it either. Blog post writing has study and sharing purposes, but before that it’s also my hobby. So at first I thought about writing posts consistently but not promoting them. But I concluded it’s better to just keep doing what I’ve been doing until a clear conclusion emerges.</p>\n<p>Actually, this is burden I feel myself. Besides this, blog post writing has been beneficial for me if anything — there’s nothing that would be harmful. So rather than various thoughts, I’m trying to focus just on the act of writing itself. That’s why even now I’m writing without thinking much.</p>\n<p>And I think anxious feelings arising from these reasons will naturally blur once I study consistently, gradually grow, and gain much confidence. This process is also me growing and a good opportunity to leave my comfort zone, so I think I should face it head-on and overcome it.</p>\n<p>For now, I think the best I can do is just be grateful that people are interested in and watching over me while consistently scribbling writing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This post was, in a sense, writing for myself rather than others — something I haven’t done in truly a long while. Organizing thoughts while writing seems to somewhat subside my anxious heart.</p>\n<p>I think not just me, but others in similar situations probably feel similar emotions. Sure, unemployed life doing what you want without working is certainly comfortable, but accompanying burden and anxiety naturally follow.</p>\n<p>Plus, anxiety arising in this state easily amplifies with just trivial daily frustrations, making such mental management even more important.</p>\n<p>Still, through this process of organizing thoughts in writing, I could clearly know why I feel anxious and define my own solutions accordingly. Isn’t this exactly writing’s charm?</p>\n<p>Of course, I won’t completely shake it off. As a human, worrying about uncertain futures and feeling anxious emotions is natural.</p>\n<p>But compared to vaguely trembling in anxiety, being chased while forcing unwanted study or writing posts with burden, it’s self-evident that having a much healthier mindset means clearly recognizing what direction I can grow toward through this study, and having faith that my written posts can positively influence others.</p>\n<p>Failing interviews is disappointing, but lacking skills can be filled through study. Since I’m unemployed anyway, I have plenty of time to study. Actually, this time will also become missed time once I become an office worker again someday, so I’m trying to enjoy it as comfortably as possible.</p>\n<p>Having the hobby of writing that can calm anxious feelings might be happiness itself in a way.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20191116-the-way-to-control-anxiety-en","path":"/2019/11/16/the-way-to-control-anxiety/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Facing Anxiety

순간순간은 즐거웠지만, 틈만 나면 빨리 집에 가서 바로 책과 노트북을 피고 공부해야한다는 생각이 떠올랐다.</p>\n<p>그냥 딱 봐도 건강한 마음의 상태는 아니다. 물론 겉으로는 아닌 척하고 있지만 속에서부터 곪아가고 있는 상태인 것이다. 그래서 필자는 공부를 잠깐 멈추고, 도대체 무엇 때문에 이렇게 불안해하며 쫓기고 있는 것인지 생각해보기 시작했다.</p>\n<p>물론 간만에 면접에서 털려보면서 필자의 약점을 날 것으로 마주하게 되었다는 이유가 크겠지만, 단순히 이것 때문에 이 정도까지 불안한 마음이 생긴다는 것은 조금 이상했다. 솔직히 면접 털려본 것이 한 두번도 아니니 말이다.</p>\n<p>그렇게 하루 정도 깊게 고민을 해보고나니 몇 가지 불안 요인이 정리가 되었고, 이후 필자는 이 요인들을 리스트업하고 하나씩 살펴보기 시작했다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"현실과-이상의-괴리\" style=\"position:relative;\">현실과 이상의 괴리<a href=\"#%ED%98%84%EC%8B%A4%EA%B3%BC-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81%EC%9D%98-%EA%B4%B4%EB%A6%AC\" aria-label=\"현실과

하면서 살 수는 없다”였다. <small>(물론 여기에는 반드시 “공부해라”라는 말이 따라온다)</small></p>\n<p>시간이 지나 군대를 다녀오고 대학교에 복학하면서 당시 어른들이 했던 이 말의 의미를 조금씩 이해하게 되었다. 세상 만사 내 맘대로 되는 일만 있는 것은 아니니 어느 정도는 마음을 내려놓으라는 가르침이었으리라.</p>\n<p>죽어도 공부하기 싫은 날에도 장학금을 위해 밤새워가며 공부를 해야했고, 군대에 가기 싫었지만 국방의 의무 때문에 23개월동안 구르다 왔던 경험을 하고 나니 “음, 그 말이 바로 이런 느낌이군”이라는 생각을 했던 것 같다.</p>\n<p>그래도 하기 싫은 일을 돈 때문에 억지로 하면서 평생 살고 싶지는 않았기에, 내 인생의 행복을 위해서는 “하고 싶은 일”을 가장 우선 순위로 높게 잡고 있었고, 다행히도 개발자라는 직업을 가지게 되면서 사회의 일원으로써의 자리와 직장인으로써의 안정적인 수입, 그리고 내가 즐기며 할 수 있는 일까지 거머쥔 덕업일치의 생활을 할 수 있었다.</p>\n<p>그러나 개발자로 일을 하게되면 행복하기만 할 것이라는 필자의 생각과는 달리 개발자로의 삶은 치열했다. 이제부터는 시험 등수나 장학금을 위한 경쟁이 아닌 진짜 생존을 건 경쟁이 시작된 것이다.</p>\n<p>아직 성 차별, 학력 차별 등 여러가지 문제가 산재하기는 하지만 기본적으로 2019년의 대한민국은 모든 사람에게 평등한 기회를 주려고 노력하는 사회이고, 그런 기회는 보통 개인의 능력이나 실력으로 거머쥘 수 있다.</p>\n<p>그 중에서도 특히 IT업계의 대표적인 전문직인 개발자는 진짜 실력 하나로 비벼서 먹고 살아가는 실력몰빵주의라고 할 수 있다. 도태되지 않기 위해서는 끊임없이 공부를 하면서 빠르게 변화하는 기술 트렌드나 패러다임을 따라가야하는 것이다. 그래서 개발자들 사이에서는 치킨 집을 차리기 전까지는 계속 공부해야한다는 자조섞인 농담을 나누기도 한다.</p>\n<p>그래도 필자는 프로그래밍 공부를 한다는 것 자체가 너무 재밌고 좋았다. 애초에 내가 하고 싶은 일을 선택한 것이기도 하고 공부하면 할수록 내가 만든 어플리케이션이 더 좋은 구조, 좋은 성능을 가질 수 있으니까.</p>\n<p>하지만 앞서 이야기 했듯이, 최근 한 달 동안 컴퓨터 사이언스의 기초를 공부하면서 필자는 마냥 즐겁지만은 않았다.</p>\n<p>사실 필자가 즐겁지 않은 공부를 하며 가장 의아했던 부분은 이렇게 기초를 공부하는 과정은 이미 대학생 때 한번 겪었던 경험인데 그때 당시와 지금 느끼는 감정이 너무나도 다르다는 것이었다. 당시에는 똑같은 공부를 해도 하나하나 신기하고 너무 재미있었기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>그럼 대학생 때는 그렇게 재미있었던 내용들이 왜 지금와서는 재미가 없어진 것일까?</p>\n<p>그 이유는 바로 공부의 동기 때문이다. <a href=\"/2019/08/26/how-does-developer-study/\">개발자가 공부로 살아남는 방법</a> 포스팅에서도 한 번 이야기한 적이 있지만, 사실 공부라는 것은 주제의 난이도보다도 건강한 동기 부여가 더 중요하다.</p>\n<p>하지만 필자는 현재 자의적으로 컴퓨터 사이언스 기초에 대한 공부를 하는 것이 아니라 구직 중이라는 외부 상황에 떠밀려서 공부를 하고 있는 상황이다. 더 쉽게 이야기해보자면, 필자가 원하는 주제를 필요에 따라 공부하는 것이 아니라 당장 하고 싶지 않은데 외부 상황 때문에 억지로 하고 있는 공부인 것이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <div style=\"width: 300px;\">\n    <span

어디서 일하느냐가 그렇게 중요하지 않다고 생각했기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>그런 식으로 직장을 고르다보니까 스스로 좀 더 많은 권한을 부여받고 많은 일을 할 수 있는 작은 규모의 스타트업을 주로 다니게 되었다.</p>\n<p>그러나 최근 주변에 있는 많은 개발자분들이 “작은 곳도 경험해보고 큰 곳도 경험해봐라”라는 조언을 많이 해주셨다. 조금 더 다양한 경험을 해보고 성장하라는 의미인 것이다. 그런 이유로 이번에는 지금까지 다녔던 직장보다는 조금 더 규모가 있는 곳을 목표로 잡고 있다.</p>\n<p>그러나 큰 회사들의 경우, 채용 과정과 원하는 인재상까지 필자가 지금까지 다녔던 규모의 회사들과는 조금 다르다.</p>\n<p>규모가 작은 스타트업의 경우 말 그대로 일당백의 당장 일할 수 있는 개발자가 필요하다. 만들어야하는 프로덕트는 산더미같은데 리소스는 늘 부족하다보니 한 사람 한 사람이 많은 역할을 할 수 밖에 없는 것이다. 게다가 리소스가 부족하다보니 누군가를 체계적으로 교육하거나 스스로 학습할 수 있는 여유도 큰 회사에 비해 상대적으로 부족한 경우가 많다.</p>\n<p>이에 반해 큰 회사들은 당장 입사해서 일할 수 있는 개발자를 급하게 찾는 입장은 아니다. 물론 어떤 회사던지 개발자라는 자원은 많으면 많을수록 좋기 때문에 계속 채용을 하기는 하지만, 규모가 작은 스타트업에 비교해봤을 때 당장 일할 사람이 부족해서 허덕이고 있는 정도의 상황은 아닐 가능성이 높다.</p>\n<p>게다가 시스템의 규모 또한 해당 개발팀의 규모에 비례해서 늘어날 수 있기 때문에, 이미 많은 개발자를 보유하고 있는 회사의 시스템은 크기도 방대하고 구조도 복잡한 경우가 많다.</p>\n<p>이런 이유들로 인해 규모가 큰 곳일수록 특정 프레임워크에 익숙한지 물어보기보다는 “네가 이걸 진짜 제대로 알고 쓰는거니?”에 집중하는 경우가 많기 때문에 컴퓨터 사이언스나 사용하는 언어에 대한 기초를 깊게 물어보는 것이다.</p>\n<p>필자도 당연히 이런 사실들을 알고는 있었지만, 한국에 돌아오고 처음 면접을 볼 때까지만 해도 솔직히 별 걱정이 없었다. 그냥 “붙으면 다니고 아니면 다른 데 가지 뭐” 정도의 마음이었던 것 같다. 실제로 첫 면접에 떨어진 직후에는 불안한 마음이고 뭐고 멘탈에 별 타격이 없었다.</p>\n<p>그래도 면접에 떨어졌으니 필자가 현재 부족한 것이 무엇인지 알 수 있었고, 당연히 이 부분을 보완하고 싶다는 마음이 생기게 되었다. 하지만 이상하게도 공부를 하면 할수록 뭔가 마음이 싱숭생숭해지기 시작했다.</p>\n<p>얼마 전 SNS에서 여친이랑 헤어진 남자의 심리 변화라는 짤을 본 적이 있다. 여친이랑 헤어진 직후는 후련하고 자유로운 기분이지만 시간이 지나면서 그리운 감정이 커지게되고 후회한다는 그런 내용이었다. 뭔가 그런 느낌이랄까.</p>\n<p>공부를 하면 할수록 면접장에서 제대로 대답하지 못했던 상황들이 계속 떠올랐고, 뒤늦은 부끄러움과 후회가 밀려온 것이다. 그와 동시에 스스로에 대한 실망감도 들기 시작했다.</p>\n<p>솔직히 말하자면 나름 컴퓨터 사이언스에 대해서 알고 있다고 생각했다. 학교에서도 이미 한 번씩 배운 내용들이고, 나름 이것저것 분석해보면서 쌓은 지식들도 있었기 때문이다. 그러나 현실은 달랐다.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a

있겠다.</p>\n<p>지금까지 필자는 포스팅을 적고 다른 사람들과 내 지식과 생각을 공유하기 위한 목적으로 약간의 홍보를 통해 포스팅을 공유해왔다. 그러다보니 필자의 글을 재밌게 읽어주신 분들이 “포스팅 잘 읽었다”, “좋은 정보 공유 감사하다” 정도의 말씀을 해주시는 경우가 생기게 되었는데, 이때까지는 내 지식이 다른 사람들에게 도움이 될 수 있다는 사실에 그냥 기분이 좋았다.</p>\n<p>하지만 최근 오프라인에서 필자를 알아보는 사람이 나타나는 경험을 몇 번 겪으면서 약간의 부담감이 스물스물 피어나게 되었다. <small>(이럴거라고는 진짜 상상도 못 했다)</small></p>\n<p>이 감정이 최대로 증폭되는 경우는 바로 면접관이 “평소에 블로그 잘 보고 있어요”라고 하는 경우인데, 이때의 당혹감과 부담감이란 말로 표현할 수가 없다. 긴장을 안하고 있다가도 한 순간에 긴장하게 만들어버리는 마법의 단어인 것 같다.</p>\n<p>그냥 사람들이 알아보는 것 자체가 부담스럽다는 뜻은 아니다. 사람들이 필자를 알아보기 시작하면서 조금씩 타인의 시선을 신경쓰기 시작했다는 것이 문제다.</p>\n<p>사실 필자가 블로그 포스팅을 작성하는 이유는 필자의 지식을 타인에게 공유하고 싶다는 목적도 있지만 기본적으로는 공부한 내용을 정리하려는 목적이 크다. 자신의 지식을 글로 정리하는 과정에서 공부의 효율성을 높히고 기억에 오래 남는 효과를 기대하는 것이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 필자가 엄청 뛰어난 기억력을 가지고 있지 않은 이상, 몇 번 공부한 내용이라고 한들 실제로 그 지식을 사용하지않고 오랜 기간이 지난다면 기억에서 점점 잊혀지기 마련이다. 결국 뭐가 되었든 공부의 기본은 반복 학습이고, 한 번 포스팅을 작성했다고 해서 그 지식이 온전히 필자의 것이 되는 게 아니라는 말이다.</p>\n<p>그런 이유 때문에 필자는 계속 스스로 과거에 작성했던 포스팅을 읽어보면서 되새김질하기도 한다.</p>\n<p>그러나 글을 읽는 독자 입장에서는 포스팅을 작성한 사람이 이 지식을 완벽하게 알고 있다는 생각이 들 수도 있다. 필자만 해도 다른 개발자 분들의 블로그 포스팅을 읽어보면서 막연하게 블로그 포스팅을 잘 쓰는 사람과 실력이 좋은 사람을 동일시했었다. 이 내용에 대해서 빠삭하게 잘 아니까 이렇게 글도 잘 쓰겠지라는 생각 때문이었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 글을 잘 쓰고 정리를 잘 한다는 것이 필자의 프로그래밍 실력이 좋다는 것을 의미하진 않는다. 독자들이 생각하고 기대하는 것보다 필자의 실력이 만족스럽지 않을 수도 있다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>필자가 느끼는 부담감은 이런 상황에서 비롯된 것이었다. 다른 사람이 “에반님 그때 정리해주신 그 내용 말이에요~“라고 운을 떼는 순간, “이거 대답 못하면 어쩌지?”라는 생각이 들게 된다. 특히 그 사람이 면접관이라면 더 그렇다.</p>\n<p>또한 간혹 고수, 존경과 같은 과분한 말을 해주시는 경우도 있는데, 애초에 필자는 고수도 아니고 누군가에게 존경받을 만한 사람은 더더욱 아닌, 그저 일개 4년차 꼬꼬마 개발자이기 때문에 감사한 마음과 동시에 약간의 부담감이 생기기도 햇다.</p>\n<p>그래서 이런 상황들을 겪을 때마다 이런 생각이 들기 시작했다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>내 실력은 3 정도 밖에 안 되는데, 사람들이 내 실력을 6이나 7 정도로 생각하면 어떡하지?</li>\n<li>내가 쓴 포스팅에 대한 질문에 제대로 답변하지 못하면 어떡하지?</li>\n<li>난 존경받을만한 사람도 아니고 고수도 아닌데… 내가 이런 말을 들을 자격이 되는건가…?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>그런 이유로 언젠가부터 점점 “사람들이 생각하는 나”라는 껍데기를 만들어야한다는 강박관념이 스물스물 피어나기 시작했고, 그 와중에 면접에서 거하게 털리면서 이 불안감 또한 함께 증폭된 것이다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"결국은-마인드의-문제다\"

보완해야하니 말이다.</p>\n<p>그러나 이번 한 번만 공부하고 말 것이 아니라면 이런 식의 동기 부여는 좋지 않다. 외압에 의한 동기 부여는 잠깐 동안 스스로를 몰아 세우며 빠르게 성장할 수는 있어도, 지속적인 성장에는 오히려 걸림돌이 된다.</p>\n<p>사실 근본적으로 생각해보면 대학생 때나 지금이나 공부하고 있는 내용은 크게 다르지 않다. 하지만 그때는 기초 공부가 재미있었고 지금은 아니었던 이유가 바로 여기에 있다.</p>\n<p>당시에는 내가 이걸 공부함으로써 성장할 수 있다는 사실이 동기가 되었지만, 지금은 면접에 붙어야한다는 사실이 동기가 되었기 때문에 같은 것을 공부해도 상당히 다른 느낌을 받을 수 밖에 없다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 다시 초심으로 돌아가 성장 자체에 초점을 맞춰 보려고 한다. 비록 빡센 기초 공부의 시작은 면접 때문이었을지 몰라도, 결과적으로는 필자가 성장할 수 있는 좋은 기회이기도 하기 때문이다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"면접은-그냥-면접일-뿐\" style=\"position:relative;\">면접은 그냥 면접일 뿐<a

평가하고 있지만, 이렇게 하더라도 컴퓨터 사이언스라는 학문의 범위가 너무 넓기 때문에 진짜 그 사람의 모든 강점과 약점을 파악한다는 것은 거의 불가능하다.</p>\n<p>하지만 회사든 구직자든 면접 한번 보자고 서로 며칠 씩이나 붙어있을 수는 없는 노릇이니 최대한 짧은 시간 안에 객관적이고 효율적으로 실력을 평가할 수 있는 방법이나 질문을 통해 구직자를 평가하려고 노력하는 것이다.</p>\n<p>당연히 이러한 사실은 회사도 알고 있기 때문에 면접관 스스로 혹은 회사의 가이드대로 어느 정도 객관성을 띄고 있는 질문을 준비하기는 하지만, 이 질문이 구직자의 강점이나 약점을 얼마나 캐낼 수 있는지는 며느리도 모르는 일이다.</p>\n<p>그 말인 즉슨, 면접의 평가 결과는 어느 정도 단편성을 지니고 있을 수 밖에 없다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 면접 과정에서 구직자가 면접관이 물어본 질문에 대답을 못했을 경우, 그 질문이 구직자의 약점을 관통했다는 것 자체는 물론 사실이다. 그래서 필자도 질문에 대답하지 못했던 내용을 정리하고 공부했던 것이다.</p>\n<p>그러나 약점이 존재한다는 것이 실력없고 형편없다는 의미는 아니다. 약점은 보완하면 되는 것이고, 면접은 무슨 수능처럼 1년에 한 번만 볼 수 있는 것도 아니니까 다음 기회에 다시 도전하면 된다.</p>\n<p>필자의 보컬 선생님 말을 빌리자면, 오히려 그런 기회를 통해 자신의 약점을 발견할 수 있음에 감사하라고 한다. 이런 기회조차 없는 상황이라면 오히려 더 성장하기 힘들 것이라는 이야기도 들었다.</p>\n<p>이게 그저 정신승리라고 생각하는 사람도 있겠지만, 스스로 건강한 마음을 가질 수 있어야만 꾸준한 도전이 가능하기 때문에 이런 식의 멘탈 케어는 개인의 성장이나 발전에도 도움이 된다고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>중요한 것은 면접에 떨어졌다는 것이 아니라, 면접을 통해 자신의 약점을 발견하고 올바른 동기 부여를 통해 꾸준한 공부를 할 수 있는 원동력을 확보하는 것이기 때문이다.</p>\n<h3

포스팅은 꾸준히 쓰되 홍보를 하지말까라는 생각도 했었지만, 뭔가 명확한 결론이 나기 전까지는 그냥 하던대로 하는 것이 좋겠다는 결론을 내렸다.</p>\n<p>사실 이건 필자 스스로 느끼는 부담감이고, 이것 외에는 블로그 포스팅 작성이 필자에게 득이 되었으면 되었지 실이 될 만한 것은 없기 때문이다. 그래서 이런 저런 생각보다는 글쓰기라는 행위 자체에만 집중하려고 한다. 그래서 지금도 아무 생각없이 일단 글을 쓰고 있다.</p>\n<p>그리고 이런 이유 때문에 생기는 불안한 마음은 필자가 꾸준히 공부해서 점점 성장하고 자신감이 많이 붙게 된다면 자연스럽게 흐려질 것이라고 생각한다. 이런 과정 또한 필자가 성장하는 과정이고 컴포트 존을 벗어날 수 있는 좋은 기회일테니, 정면으로 부딪혀서 극복해봐야 하는 것 아닐까싶다.</p>\n<p>일단 지금은 그냥 필자에게 관심을 가지고 지켜봐주시는 분들이 있다는 것에 감사하며 꾸준히 글이나 끄적이는 게 최선인 것 같다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"마치며\" style=\"position:relative;\">마치며<a href=\"#%EB%A7%88%EC%B9%98%EB%A9%B0\" aria-label=\"마치며
