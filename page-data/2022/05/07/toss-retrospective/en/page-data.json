So I started having coffee chats with various folks - C-level executives, HR people, VCs doing investment screening, and others - where we’d ask each other questions about what we were curious about.</p>\n<p>After several of these coffee chats, I’d sometimes visit their companies to meet the developers directly, suggest solutions to their technical challenges, and if I was curious about their business, I’d even get the chance to meet co-founders for deeper conversations. <small>(Reading this back, it sounds kind of like dating)</small></p>\n<p>I got asked a lot of questions during this process, but aside from technical stuff, the question I heard most often - and usually right at the beginning - was this:</p>\n<center>\n  <br>\n  <div style=\"max-width: 300px;\">\n    <img src=\"/ba4b53d43a9bececa2dac7b1b849aee8/question.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n  </div>\n  <small>How does Toss work like that?</small>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>In the IT industry, Toss has a somewhat two-sided reputation. The positive image is that it’s a team that works incredibly well and fast. The negative image is that it’s a sweatshop with too much work.</p>\n<p>Of course, from an employee’s perspective like mine, both working well and having personal time are important, so I’d weigh those two factors. But for people running companies or investors who’ve put money in, they’re naturally more interested in the first factor - “how to work fast and well” - so that question really meant “how can you work that fast and that well?”</p>\n<h3 id=\"dri-culture-where-you-chart-your-own-path\" style=\"position:relative;\">DRI culture where you chart your own path<a href=\"#dri-culture-where-you-chart-your-own-path\" aria-label=\"dri culture where you chart your own path permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) is exactly what it sounds like - the person with final decision-making authority on a matter. This concept was first introduced to Apple by Steve Jobs, and it’s deeply embedded in Toss as well.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think the driving force behind Toss’s fast pace is a culture where each person’s final decision-making authority as a DRI is tremendously respected. At Toss, decision-making power isn’t concentrated in the CEO - it’s distributed across the entire team.</p>\n<p>In reality, Toss is a place where leaders can’t easily dictate a product’s direction. That’s because the DRI for each product belongs to the silo building that product, and specifically to that silo’s PO (Product Owner).</p>\n<p>Of course, the CEO’s authority definitely exists at Toss, and the weight of the CEO’s words is heavier than others’. But what made Toss different from other companies was that you’d often see POs fighting with the CEO, and the POs would frequently win. <small>(Watching a CEO and PO duke it out to the death isn’t something you typically see at companies of any significant size)</small></p>\n<p>At Toss, being a DRI is like a sacred, inviolable zone. Having a DRI means your colleagues trust your abilities in that area, and losing your DRI means losing your colleagues’ trust and becoming someone the team doesn’t need anymore. So everyone fights tooth and nail to defend their DRI by earning trust from colleagues and trying to help the team.</p>\n<p>In other words, even if you’re the CEO, if you try to crush and overturn someone’s DRI with leadership authority, the reaction won’t be “Well, the CEO wants it, so I guess we have to…” but rather “Who the hell are you to threaten my DRI?” At Toss, messing with someone’s DRI tends to really piss people off. <small>(Crudely speaking, you might trigger someone’s rage button)</small></p>\n<p>That’s why I say that at Toss, even the CEO - the company’s owner - can’t easily tell product development what to do. In fact, there are cases where a PO pushed forward with an item the CEO said not to do, and succeeded. These successful experiences accumulate and make the culture of respecting DRIs even stronger.</p>\n<p>Of course, the CEO has more business insights than POs because of years in this domain, but since the DRI for product direction belongs to that silo’s PO, the Toss CEO usually plays more of an advisor role.</p>\n<p>And thanks to this DRI system, each silo can determine their product’s direction themselves, develop it, observe the results, and iterate to evolve the product. Since there’s no pointless reporting or checking procedures in this process, the people making the product can decide “I want to make this!” and develop something like the <a href=\"https://blog.toss.im/article/disasterfund-behindstory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disaster Relief Fund</a> in just a day or two.</p>\n<p>I felt that the reason Toss can work fast and have fun doing it starts with this complete delegation of authority. Since it’s not about someone ordering you to make something, but team members coming up with their own ideas and evolving the product, the level of attachment to the product can’t help but be high.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-culture-tolerant-of-failure\" style=\"position:relative;\">A culture tolerant of failure<a href=\"#a-culture-tolerant-of-failure\" aria-label=\"a culture tolerant of failure permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Toss is an organization that’s incredibly forgiving of failures from new attempts. There was even a core value about having the courage to fail fast, and they held events like Failure Party where people shared their failure cases across the company.</p>\n<p>The reason for this culture is pretty simple - to provide an environment where people can try new things without fear of failure.</p>\n<p>Physicist Safi Bahcall, in his book <a href=\"http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/90061659\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loon Shots</a>, says that one formula for success is to rapidly and frequently attempt projects that the majority ignores and neglects.

The focus isn’t on the fact of failure itself, but on recognizing what was learned from the failure and sharing it with others so the same failure doesn’t happen twice.</p>\n<p>Of course, sayings like “failure can’t be prevented” or “you grow by using failure as a stepping stone” are things many people already know, but actually infusing a culture that doesn’t fear failure into an organization is harder than you’d think.</p>\n<p>That’s why Toss runs campaigns like Failure Party to internally promote “how tolerant we are of failure,” or has the culture team and leaders constantly talk about how “it’s okay to fail.”</p>\n<p>In other words, to establish a culture where organization members don’t fear failure, you can’t just not criticize someone when they experience failure - you need more proactive actions alongside that.</p>\n<p>The truth is, most people have experienced more cultures that dismiss failure rather than encourage it throughout their lives, so even with these proactive actions, a culture that doesn’t fear failure won’t take root overnight. This kind of culture slowly seeps in through efforts to build it being consistently performed from the moment the company is founded until the day it shuts down.</p>\n<p>Plus, culture has a kind of inertia that tries to maintain the current state, so introducing it midway costs more than building it from the start. Ultimately, if you want to establish a culture that doesn’t fear failure in your team, you’ll need to continuously think about and perform actions that are at least more radical and proactive than Toss’s.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-ceo-also-works-to-maintain-the-culture\" style=\"position:relative;\">The CEO also works to maintain the culture<a href=\"#the-ceo-also-works-to-maintain-the-culture\" aria-label=\"the ceo also works to maintain the culture permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>But settling these kinds of cultures into a typical startup isn’t easy. That’s because corporate culture is most influenced by the CEO, and from the CEO’s perspective, handing over DRIs to individual contributors or just watching team members fail requires quite a bit of courage.</p>\n<p>Usually we vent this kind of not-quite-complaint over drinks with friends:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our CEO micromanages even the tiniest details, it’s exhausting… Do they not trust us…? If this is how it is, why did they hire me?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, I sympathize with this. Generally, CEOs are experts in management, not product development experts. Honestly, from the perspective of the PO, designer, or developer actually building that product, it can be annoying and frustrating to have someone who isn’t even an expert tell you what to do.</p>\n<p>But if you flip the perspective for a moment, that’s actually more natural and human. Because the CEO is the person who can grab the biggest profit when the company does well, but conversely, they’re also the person bearing the biggest risk when it fails.</p>\n<p>Generally, when startups receive investment, investors evaluate the company’s value, calculate the price per share based on that valuation, and invest by transferring shares. But the process of investors investing in startups is a bit different from how we normally buy and sell stocks.</p>\n<p>To minimize investment risk, investors use methods like buying corporate bonds to lend money and later converting the bonds to shares <small>(CB, convertible bonds)</small>, or setting conditions where they can demand the company buy back shares whenever they want or continuously receive dividends <small>(RCPS, redeemable convertible preferred shares)</small>, or actively using clauses that let them demand their shares be sold along when the controlling shareholder sells their stake <small>(Tag-along)</small> as safety nets.</p>\n<p>Especially investors with preferred shares like RCPS have priority over common shareholders in various rights, and the problem is that CEOs also hold common shares.</p>\n<p>So if an investor with preferred shares exercises rights like receiving priority distribution of remaining assets over common shareholders when the company fails and is liquidated, or the right to force the company to buy back shares at any point during the contract period, situations can arise where the company must honor these rights even at a loss.</p>\n<p>In other words, startup investment is absolutely not free, and if the business doesn’t go well, the CEO can definitely suffer significant financial losses too. And as you all know, these amounts aren’t pocket change.</p>\n<p>Honestly, in this situation, delegating all decision-making authority about product direction to employees or tolerating failure isn’t easy at all. Even with employees you hired yourself, it’s hard to trust they’ll think “this is my business” like you do.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/a133e4bae8986cb83c7de28c3bdd1b9e/8e1fc/out.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"out\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/a133e4bae8986cb83c7de28c3bdd1b9e/c08c5/out.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/a133e4bae8986cb83c7de28c3bdd1b9e/0913d/out.jpg 160w,\n/static/a133e4bae8986cb83c7de28c3bdd1b9e/cb69c/out.jpg 320w,\n/static/a133e4bae8986cb83c7de28c3bdd1b9e/c08c5/out.jpg 640w,\n/static/a133e4bae8986cb83c7de28c3bdd1b9e/8e1fc/out.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Wait, this guy's defending CEOs? Turns out he was on management's side all along?</small>\n</center>\n<p>The reason I’m saying all this isn’t “so let’s understand CEOs’ micromanaging” - it’s actually the opposite. What I want to say is that despite shouldering these huge risks, if you want to succeed in business, the CEO must be the first to work on building a culture of trusting team members and delegating authority.</p>\n<p>No matter how amazing a CEO is, one person can’t do everything in the world well. Plus, if you’ve recruited senior-level team members, that means they’re much more veteran than the CEO in their field, and a proper senior can definitely track business-level issues while making decisions.</p>\n<p>In other words, it’s more efficient to delegate authority to team members and collaborate with each person handling their specialty rather than the CEO telling everyone what to do.</p>\n<p>Of course, working together means you’ll see trusted team members fail sometimes and you might be disappointed. But once a CEO starts micromanaging because of a few failures by team members, even if your team members could do well in some areas, they’ll give up on showing their abilities thinking “they’ll do whatever they want anyway,” or in the worst case, capable employees will leave the company.</p>\n<p>If the CEO interferes in every little thing and restricts my abilities, why would I stay here when it’s neither fun nor conducive to growth?</p>\n<p>If this situation repeats, the company will either see all the people who actively make decisions and demonstrate their abilities leave, or become passive, and you’ll end up with a half-assed organization where employees can’t decide anything themselves unless the CEO makes every decision.</p>\n<p>The reason I still think Toss’s CEO Seunggun is amazing isn’t simply because he works well or is smart - it’s because he recognizes these issues himself and is directly leading the culture of delegating authority.</p>\n<p>No matter how great someone is, as long as they’re human, they’d naturally have fear of business failure, but overcoming that fear, fully trusting team members, delegating authority, and building a culture that encourages failure - that’s not normal-person-level mentality.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Toss culture I mentioned earlier about DRIs or an environment where you can freely experience failure might not be the right answer. In fact, Toss keeps trying new things and evolving the culture too.</p>\n<p>But whatever that culture is, it’s hard for it to take root in an organization without the CEO’s - the leader’s - attention. No matter how much team members interested in culture run around trying things, if the CEO just says “don’t do that,” everything rolls back, making their efforts rather meaningless. And even if you somehow establish a culture, if the leader doesn’t make efforts to maintain it, other team members won’t bother maintaining it either.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problems-of-a-rapidly-growing-organization\" style=\"position:relative;\">Problems of a rapidly growing organization<a href=\"#problems-of-a-rapidly-growing-organization\" aria-label=\"problems of a rapidly growing organization permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Actually, while Toss’s culture had many interesting aspects and was a new experience, the most valuable thing I experienced at this company wasn’t the culture.</p>\n<p>The most valuable thing I got from Toss was the opportunity to seriously think about “what is a senior developer” while actually performing that role.</p>\n<p>When I had my first salary negotiation after joining Toss, I got feedback to become someone who could grow the team, not just myself.</p>\n<p>I’d already been thinking about what being a senior means, and I was heading in a somewhat similar direction.

And as I mentioned earlier, in an environment littered with people who work well, my own growth comes first - I didn’t have time to worry about others’ growth.</p>\n<p>Of course, technical discussions and in-house study groups were actively happening, but these activities weren’t so much about growing someone less capable than me, but more about stimulating each other and growing together. So I remember the frontend chapter back then felt like similar-level friends gathering to stimulate each other and grow together.</p>\n<p>In other words, I can list the internal culture of the frontend chapter at that time like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Because there were few people, everyone knew each other’s faces and names and had high intimacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There was high trust in each other’s abilities, and members felt they were trusted by teammates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Based on this intimacy and trust, there was psychological safety formed around the frontend chapter as an organization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-emergence-of-the-concept-of-junior-developers\" style=\"position:relative;\">The emergence of the concept of junior developers<a href=\"#the-emergence-of-the-concept-of-junior-developers\" aria-label=\"the emergence of the concept of junior developers permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>But this frontend chapter culture started changing a bit starting in 2020. I think there were two main causes - one was that the chapter size, which had been barely in the low teens, grew rapidly and fast, and the other was the emergence of the concept of “junior.”</p>\n<p>Actually, until then the frontend chapter already had trust formed, so the very concept of needing to unilaterally help someone else grow was minimal.</p>\n<p>But when Toss took an aggressive hiring stance of betting on people with high growth potential even if their current skills weren’t outstanding by creating programs like <a href=\"https://toss.im/career/next-developer-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NEXT Developer</a>, Toss started having a persona of “team members who need help to grow,” and we called this persona “junior.”</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/6052f/next2021.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 70.625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"next2021\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/6af66/next2021.png\" srcset=\"/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/69538/next2021.png 160w,\n/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/72799/next2021.png 320w,\n/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/6af66/next2021.png 640w,\n/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/d9199/next2021.png 960w,\n/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/21b4d/next2021.png 1280w,\n/static/e2829c2438dce41760ecec2a2fbe9220/6052f/next2021.png 2030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The NEXT Developer job posting page says in huge letters \"developers with 3 years or less experience\"</small>\n</center>\n<p>NEXT Developer felt like a kind of junior job fair, and the problem was that the psychological state of people hired through a recruitment funnel that externally communicated “We’re hiring juniors!” was somewhat different from those who joined through the regular hiring process.</p>\n<p>Of course, we were able to recruit many excellent people through that program, but I felt that the behavioral patterns of some people hired through NEXT Developer were slightly different from existing people. Typical differences I noticed were roughly like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Why does everyone mostly just say it’s good, it’s fine? Don’t they have anything they don’t like?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That opinion is a subjective opinion without basis, why are they just accepting it?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why aren’t they actively participating in chapter activities?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, these characteristics are typical of new hires who haven’t adapted to the organization yet, so you might think it’s not that strange. But the Toss new hires I’d experienced until then usually strongly challenged problems the existing chapter had even shortly after joining, or actively contributed to in-house libraries.</p>\n<p>It was also strange to just chalk it up to differences in skill or years of experience, because even among people hired through the same NEXT Developer funnel, some showed these behavioral patterns and some didn’t.

From then on, I thought this wasn’t simply a difference in hard skills but a problem of self-confidence.</p>\n<p>While Toss aims for a challenging culture and transparent feedback culture, these things require a foundation of confidence that you’re doing at least your fair share of work within the team. When you’re uncertain whether you’re doing well or not, it takes tremendous courage to actively push your opinions or give feedback to others.</p>\n<p>There was also a difference in psychological safety about the organization. Before, when the chapter had only about 10 people and similar technical levels, it was an environment where people quickly became close and trust formed easily.</p>\n<p>When you know well what kind of person everyone is and their working style, even if you exchange somewhat blunt feedback, it’s easy to have a kind of certainty that this person is telling you this for the team’s development and there’s no emotion in this feedback, and this certainty can lead to psychological safety and trust in the organization.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5d46f54049984addc8b6d03c043eb3a3/b4294/passion.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.00000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"passion\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/5d46f54049984addc8b6d03c043eb3a3/b4294/passion.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/5d46f54049984addc8b6d03c043eb3a3/0913d/passion.jpg 160w,\n/static/5d46f54049984addc8b6d03c043eb3a3/cb69c/passion.jpg 320w,\n/static/5d46f54049984addc8b6d03c043eb3a3/b4294/passion.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Toss people might seem intense, but they're just really serious about work - get to know them and many are sweethearts</small>\n</center>\n<p>But as the headcount gradually increased, we’d reached a situation where people didn’t even know each other’s names and faces, plus a hierarchy had formed within the chapter due to hard skill differences, so worries like “If I say this, will I look incompetent?” or “Is it okay for me to say this now?” naturally arose. And this situation can be a factor that lowers psychological safety about the organization.</p>\n<p>So I thought the cause of this passive behavior wasn’t simply differences in hard skill level, but differences in confidence that you can blend in as a member of this organization, and differences in the psychological safety felt in the chapter.

And this phenomenon was happening more frequently in the junior segment I mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>At first, there was strong opinion in the chapter from the “return to the past” faction saying “we should try everything we can to recreate the old atmosphere,” but as time passed and headcount grew more, opinion tilted toward the realist faction that we needed to accept reality and find methods suitable for the chapter’s current size.</p>\n<p>I was close to the realist side from the start. What I strongly argued was that even in school when everyone was the same age with similar levels, you couldn’t be close with all 40 classmates in the same class, so how can you expect the same intimacy in the current frontend chapter with even more people and hierarchy formed by hard skill levels?</p>\n<p>In other words, the frontend chapter now needed to figure out new ways to increase intimacy and create psychological safety for an organization of over 60 people, not an organization of just about 10 people.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 550px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/6167a981411988d8ff05e1fe86ac3795/d7854/school_class.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"school class\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/6167a981411988d8ff05e1fe86ac3795/d7854/school_class.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/6167a981411988d8ff05e1fe86ac3795/0913d/school_class.jpg 160w,\n/static/6167a981411988d8ff05e1fe86ac3795/cb69c/school_class.jpg 320w,\n/static/6167a981411988d8ff05e1fe86ac3795/d7854/school_class.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Even among same-age classmates, the friends you're really close with usually don't even reach 10</small>\n</center>\n<p>For that reason, Toss Core frontend chapter - which had the most people - thought about dividing people into smaller subgroups, building intimacy within them to create psychological safety about the organization, while also considering a kind of lead role that could more actively help people in those groups and infuse them with growth direction.</p>\n<p>At Toss, there’s an organization called a tribe formed by gathering small purpose-driven organizations called silos, and originally each tribe has one role called T-Lead who rallies the developers. But since T-Leads are mainly held by backend folks, it was hard to expect them to actively suggest direction and lead on frontend stuff, which isn’t their specialty.</p>\n<p>For that reason, until now the frontend chapter had been making decisions and executing action items at the chapter level, but as the chapter’s headcount rapidly increased and the organization’s density decreased, the frontend side also needed a role that could help team members more closely than the chapter lead.</p>\n<p>So at first we tried to create a role named F-Lead as an homage to T-Lead, but there was worry that the word “Lead” might actually strengthen hierarchy, and the frontend chapter’s idea of a lead role wasn’t someone managing others but someone helping teammates, so there were many opinions wanting this feeling to strongly emerge from the name itself.</p>\n<p>In other words, we expected a kind of helper role that performs work in slightly gray areas like supporting other silos, administrative work like organizational restructuring, or counseling through 1-on-1 coffee chats, creating an environment where team members can focus more on work, and helping frontend chapter members grow quickly to level up the entire chapter’s hard skills and soft skills. <small>(While also completing all their silo work…muffled)</small></p>\n<p>Through various ideation, many interesting names came up, but ultimately the role named F-Evangelist was born, and I - someone interested in chapter culture and psychological safety - ended up taking this role.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bragging-about-my-shit\" style=\"position:relative;\">Bragging about my shit<a href=\"#bragging-about-my-shit\" aria-label=\"bragging about my shit permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I consistently pushed the opinion that all people in the frontend chapter organization need an environment where they can comfortably try anything and comfortably give feedback on what they think is strange, because only then can the frontend chapter develop.</p>\n<p>When subgroups and F-Evangelist first emerged, I consistently pushed that we should focus on increasing organizational intimacy so people can feel psychological safety within the frontend chapter organization.</p>\n<p>The top priority I was thinking about at the time was making junior members of my group see developers with more years of experience or developers in specific roles like F-Evangelist not as intimidating people but just as fellow developers.</p>\n<p>No matter how much we removed the word “lead” from the role name to avoid creating hierarchy, since the actual actions are essentially those of a lead, I thought it was unrealistic to expect the distance or hierarchy people feel about this role to be completely removed with passive actions like just changing the name.</p>\n<p>Plus, Toss’s frontend chapter had several developers who’d built name value through various activities, and junior people tended to vaguely think that high name value means good skills. I judged that in a situation where hierarchy was already occurring due to hard skill differences, if this misunderstanding about name value was added, it would greatly hinder creating organizational psychological safety, so I wanted to completely remove this thinking. <small>(Being famous and being good at development have little correlation)</small></p>\n<p>So the first thing I did was a “shit bragging contest.”</p>\n<p>Generally developers aim for beautiful design, but when developing at a company, due to external factors like business situations, there are cases where you crush the design, and with tight schedules you often make bugs while rushing.</p>\n<p>In these situations, the act of writing poorly designed code or mistakes gets expressed as “taking a shit,” and I proposed we share exactly this kind of code. It was somewhat casual and a dirty name, but I wanted a space where everyone could laugh, have fun, and comfortably disclose mistakes, so I deliberately chose a fun name instead of stiff names like “sharing debt” or “retrospective.”</p>\n<p>My group had various segments distributed from completely new developers for whom Toss was their first job to developers with 6-7 years of experience. By running the shit bragging contest, I intended to inform everyone that regardless of years of experience, any developer can make mistakes and situations arise where you crush design, while sharing how experienced developers clean up this shit and what thought processes lead to the decision to crush design for speed.</p>\n<p>But I made one mistake here too - what people considered shit code differed by hard skill level. Of course, for shit with relatively low resolution difficulty, active discussion happened and problem-solving methods were suggested, but for shit that’s hard to even understand if you lack hard skills, participation was starkly divided by hard skill level.</p>\n<p>This problem had already occurred in previous study groups and offline code reviews, but when I first took on F-Evangelist, I was so eager to quickly remove psychological hierarchy that I forgot the lessons from past failures.</p>\n<p>Actually, people’s reviews of the shit bragging contest weren’t bad, but I finished the first action item without reaching my original intention of removing psychological hierarchy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finding-strengths\" style=\"position:relative;\">Finding strengths<a href=\"#finding-strengths\" aria-label=\"finding strengths permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>After that, I changed my approach direction and pushed a method of sharing many non-technical conversations so we could become close as person-to-person rather than developers, building up information.</p>\n<p>So I set up mogakko sessions where people with nothing to do on weekends gathered at pretty cafes to eat delicious things and do personal work, or used subgroup weekly meeting time as chatting time, repeatedly performing various action items and observing people’s reactions. After repeating several action items like this, intimacy definitely formed within the group compared to before, and psychological safety about the organization formed.</p>\n<p>But the issue I still hadn’t resolved was the burden junior developers carried of “I’m still lacking.” While this burden could be a great motivator for growth if it worked healthily, if this thinking became excessive, it could instead lead to drops in confidence or self-esteem and become toxic.</p>\n<p>Around that time, I noticed a designer from my silo looking at some spreadsheet, and that sheet was the result sheet from a test called “StrengthsFinder” that the design chapter had conducted.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/9568a/book.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"book\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/c08c5/book.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/0913d/book.jpg 160w,\n/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/cb69c/book.jpg 320w,\n/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/c08c5/book.jpg 640w,\n/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/6a068/book.jpg 960w,\n/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/eea4a/book.jpg 1280w,\n/static/05f8e90b592bc1d348a7a51cb03b0c1e/9568a/book.jpg 3024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>When you buy this book, they give you a code to take the StrengthsFinder test online</small>\n</center>\n<p>I don’t believe in these kinds of tests at all, so at first I thought “the design chapter did something fun again” and was going to move on, but soon I thought this test could be a good method to relieve people’s burdens. <small>(The design chapter does surprisingly many fun things like this)</small></p>\n<p>There are roughly two ways to grow - one is making what you’re bad at better, and the other is making what you’re already good at even better. But generally, developers in their growth phase tend to focus only on what they’re bad at rather than what they’re already good at, and try to fill those gaps.</p>\n<p>While focusing on and supplementing what you’re bad at is a good growth method, if you get too absorbed in the negative thought “I can’t do this,” situations can arise where you push yourself so hard that you study or work to the point of harming your health, or feel frustrated comparing yourself with developers around you.</p>\n<p>So I thought that if through the StrengthsFinder test we could give people metacognition so they could know “what they’re good at,” they’d learn both their strengths and weaknesses rather than just focusing on weaknesses, which might also build self-confidence.</p>\n<p>I talked about this idea with other frontend developers, and two people sympathized and joined to try running StrengthsFinder just among ourselves. At that time, one frontend developer belonging to the design platform team had already run StrengthsFinder with the design chapter, so they greatly helped in the process of finding methods suited to the frontend chapter based on that experience.</p>\n<p>The method of running the StrengthsFinder program was super simple - just request the company to buy the book, each person takes the test, shares the PDF test result sheet in the StrengthsFinder Slack channel, then meet offline where the facilitator explains each person’s result sheet.</p>\n<p>Here the facilitator’s role is to create an environment where team members participating in StrengthsFinder can empathize with and remember each other’s strengths rather than just reading them. The facilitator’s action items were roughly like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Rather than just reading the result sheet, give examples of situations you can actually experience at Toss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Summarize teammates’ strengths in one line to make them easy for others to remember.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have them highlight which of their strengths they want others to pay more attention to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have them decide on action items that can further strengthen each other’s strengths.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of StrengthsFinder included building metacognition about what you do well yourself, but also teaching how working as one team is a process of various people with different strengths gathering to create synergy. So we didn’t just stop at knowing our own strengths, but additionally conducted activities to actively recognize and further strengthen each other’s strengths.</p>\n<p>After running this PoC on StrengthsFinder, it explained each person’s strengths in detail and was fun, so I soon ran StrengthsFinder with the subgroup I was leading.</p>\n<p>At that time, I didn’t want team members to feel this program was part of work, and since we were running a program somewhat removed from development anyway, I wanted to give them a feeling of escaping for a day, so we met at a pretty cafe in Chungmuro rather than the office to run the StrengthsFinder program.</p>\n<p>The results were better than expected. Honestly, I didn’t have high expectations since these tests have no scientific basis so people might not believe them, but surprisingly everyone was happy learning their strengths, and greatly empathized with how being a good developer isn’t one single form but various forms, and that the frontend chapter is a team where people with various strengths must gather to create synergy.</p>\n<p>Of course, I’d told team members these things a lot through coffee chats, but I was greatly impressed that running one program or campaign like this was more effective than a hundred words.</p>\n<p>After getting good results in the subgroup, I started evangelizing at F-Evangelist meetings, explaining StrengthsFinder’s purpose and methods. The original plan was to test it first at Toss Core and export it to other affiliates if the response was good, but frontend developers from other affiliates who were lurking in the StrengthsFinder channel started spreading it on their own, and we suddenly ended up exporting StrengthsFinder.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/c549b/strong.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 57.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"strong\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/6af66/strong.png\" srcset=\"/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/69538/strong.png 160w,\n/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/72799/strong.png 320w,\n/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/6af66/strong.png 640w,\n/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/d9199/strong.png 960w,\n/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/21b4d/strong.png 1280w,\n/static/ffc77284035d39b5b0c853dc1b66ecff/c549b/strong.png 2128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>We even wrote guidelines for StrengthsFinder facilitators for smooth export</small>\n</center>\n<p>Unfortunately I left around this time so I don’t know in detail how StrengthsFinder progressed afterward, but I heard through the grapevine after leaving that other frontend developers found it fun too, and I even heard the DS (Data Scientist) team ran StrengthsFinder. <small>(The export speed is incredible…)</small></p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\" style=\"position:relative;\">Closing<a href=\"#closing\" aria-label=\"closing permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>The past 2.5 years working at Toss was time that created much foundation for growth for me. While Toss has a lot of work and is intense, I think it was an organization with that much immersion in work and growth.</p>\n<p>I got to experience what it feels like to work with capable colleagues while trusting each other, what the crazy speed of ideating a product in the morning and deploying it in the evening is like, and what the driving force that can create this productivity is - I had many experiences and thoughts.</p>\n<p>In my final exit interview, the POM (People Operation Manager) asked me “What would Toss need to improve to make you come back?” and I answered “If I come back, it would probably be when I feel that what exists at Toss doesn’t exist elsewhere.” That’s how high my satisfaction with this organization was. <small>(Looking back, that seems like a cool line…?)</small></p>\n<p>Now Toss isn’t the 300-person startup from when I joined, but has become a mid-sized company of 2,000 people. So naturally there are parts that have changed from those days, and I feel a strange nostalgia and regret about those parts. If before it felt like doing work with really close friends whether in chapters or silos, recently it feels like it’s become a bit more like being a company employee.</p>\n<p>But Toss can’t return to its former form now. The culture of 300 people and the culture of 2,000 people are naturally different.</p>\n<p>So as I moved to a small startup this time, I wanted to experience directly creating that culture I loved - the one that immerses in work to create crazy productivity - and leading the product to success.</p>\n<p>The startup I joined, Quotalab, is also <a href=\"https://quotalab.career.greetinghr.com/o/61278\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">enthusiastically hiring frontend developers</a>, so if any readers want to experience introducing a culture that creates this crazy productivity into an organization and succeeding with a product based on that culture, please apply. <small>(In IT, talent density and culture really do everything)</small></p>","fields":{"slug":"20220507-toss-retrospective-en","path":"/2022/05/07/toss-retrospective/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What I learned about growth and leadership

그대로 어떤 사안에 대한 최종의사결정권자를 의미한다. 이 개념은 스티브 잡스가 애플에 처음 도입했던 개념인데, 토스에도 이 DRI라는 개념이 뿌리깊게 박혀있다.</p>\n<p>개인적으로 토스가 빠른 속도로 일할 수 있는 원동력은 DRI라는 각자의 최종의사결정권이 굉장히 존중받는 문화에 있다고 생각한다. 토스팀은 조직의 의사결정권이 CEO 한 명에게 집중되어있는 것이 아니라 토스팀 전체의 팀원들에게 퍼져있는 문화이다.</p>\n<p>실제로 토스팀은 리더가 마음대로 제품의 방향성을 정하기 어려운 곳이다. 왜냐하면 각 제품에 대한 DRI는 그 제품을 만드는 사일로, 그 중에서도 그 사일로의 PO(Product Owner)가 가지고 있기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>물론 토스팀에도 CEO의 권위는 분명히 존재하고, 다른 사람보다 CEO가 던지는 말의 무게가 다른 사람에 비해 더 무거운 것도 사실이다. 하지만 토스팀이 다른 회사들과 달랐던 점은 PO들과 CEO가 싸우는 모습을 자주 볼 수 있다는 것, 그리고 결국 PO들이 이기는 경우가 많다는 점이다. <small>(대표랑 PO가 죽자살자 싸우는 그림은 어느 정도 규모가 있는 회사에서는 보기 힘든 모습이기는 하다)</small></p>\n<p>토스에서 DRI라는 것은 일종의 신성불가침영역과도 같다. 어떤 DRI를 맡고 있다는 것은 동료들이 해당 업무에 대한 그 사람의 능력에 대해 신뢰하고 있다는 것이고, DRI를 잃는다는 것은 동료로부터 신뢰를 잃어 더 이상 토스팀에 필요없는 사람이 되는 것과 마찬가지이기 때문에 다들 죽기살기로 자신의 DRI를 지켜내기 위해 동료로부터 신뢰를 얻고 팀에 도움이 되려고 노력한다.</p>\n<p>즉, 아무리 CEO라고 해도 이 DRI를 리더의 권위로 뭉개고 뒤집어 엎으려고 한다면 “대표가 하라면 해야지…”가 아니라 “니가 뭔데 내 DRI를 위협해”와 같은 반응이 나오기 쉬운 환경이라는 이야기이다. 쉽게 말해서 토스에서 DRI를 건드는 행위를 하게 되면 생각보다 사람들이 많이 빡친다. <small>(속된 말로 발작버튼이 눌릴 수도 있다)</small></p>\n<p>그렇기 때문에 토스팀은 회사의 오너인 CEO조차도 쉽게 제품 개발에 이래라 저래라 할 수가 없는 문화라고 이야기하는 것이다. 실제로 CEO가 하지 말자고 했던 아이템을 PO가 끝까지 밀고나가서 성공시킨 사례도 있기 때문에, 이런 성공의 경험이 쌓여서 DRI를 존중하는 문화가 더 강력하게 유지된다.</p>\n<p>물론 CEO는 오랜 기간 이 도메인에서 사업을 해왔기 때문에 PO보다 사업에 대한 인사이트가 더 많이 있을 수 있지만, 제품의 방향성에 대한 DRI는 그 사일로의 PO가 가지고 있기 때문에 보통 토스의 CEO는 조언자의 역할을 주로 하게 되는 것 같다.</p>\n<p>그리고 이 DRI 덕분에 각 사일로는 본인들이 스스로 제품의 방향성을 결정하고 개발하고 결과를 관찰하는 이터레이션을 거치며 제품을 발전시킬 수 있게 되는 것이며, 이 과정 속에서 쓸데없는 보고나 확인 같은 절차가 없기 때문에 제품을 만드는 사람이 “나 이거 만들래!”라고 의사결정을 하고 하루이틀만에 제품을 개발해내는 <a href=\"https://blog.toss.im/article/disasterfund-behindstory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">재난지원금</a> 같은 사례들이 나올 수 있는 것이다.</p>\n<p>필자는 토스가 일을 빠르게 하고, 또 재밌게 할 수 있는 이유는 바로 이러한 완전한 권한의 위임에서부터 출발한다고 느꼈다. 애초에 누가 시켜서 만드는 것이 아니라 팀원들이 스스로 아이디어를 내고 제품을 발전시키기 때문에 제품에 대한 애정도가 높을 수 밖에 없지 않을까.</p>\n<h3 id=\"실패에-관대한-문화\" style=\"position:relative;\">실패에 관대한 문화<a

않을 수 있는 환경이 결국 문샷을 만든다</small>\n</center>\n<p>토스팀은 이 룬샷을 마음 편하게 쏠 수 있는 환경을 마련해두었다. 실패했다는 사실 자체가 아니라 실패에서 무엇을 배웠는지 인지하고 이 실패를 다른 사람들에게 공유해서 두 번 다시 동일한 실패 사례가 발생하지 않도록 만드는 것에 초점을 맞추고 있는 것이다.</p>\n<p>물론 실패는 예방할 수 없다라던가 실패를 발판삼아서 성장한다던가 같은 말들은 이미 많은 사람들이 알고 있는 말이지만, 실제로 실패를 두려워하지 않는 문화를 조직에 녹여내는 것은 생각보다 쉽지않다.</p>\n<p>그래서 토스팀은 Failure Party 같이 “우리가 실패에 얼마나 관대한지”를 팀 내부적으로 홍보하는 캠페인을 진행하거나 컬쳐팀이나 리더가 꾸준히 “실패해도 괜찮다”라는 메세지를 입에 달고 다니는 것이다.</p>\n<p>즉, 이렇게 조직 구성원들이 실패를 두려워하지 않는 문화를 정착시키기 위해서는 단순히 누군가 실패를 경험했을 때 그를 비난하지 않는 것이 아니라, 그보다 적극적인 액션들이 함께 동반되어야한다.</p>\n<p>사실 대부분의 사람들은 지금까지 살아오면서 실패를 장려하는 문화가 아닌 실패를 경질하는 문화를 더 많이 경험해왔기 때문에, 이런 적극적인 액션들이 동반되더라도 실패를 두려워하지 않는 문화가 하루아침에 정착되지는 않는다. 이런 문화는 문화를 만들기 위한 노력들이 회사가 설립된 순간부터 망하는 그 날까지 꾸준히 수행되는 과정에서 천천히 스며드는 것이기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>게다가 문화는 현재 상황을 유지하려는 일종의 관성을 가지고 있기 때문에, 처음부터 빌딩하는 것보다 중간에 도입하는 것이 더 큰 비용이 든다. 결국 여러분의 팀에 실패를 두려워하지 않는 문화를 정착시키고 싶다면 적어도 토스보다도 더 파격적이고 적극적인 액션들을 지속적으로 고민하고 수행해야 할 것이다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ceo-스스로도-문화를-유지하려고-노력한다\"

문화라는 것은 CEO의 영향을 가장 많이 받을 수 밖에 없는데, CEO 입장에서 실무자들에게 DRI를 넘기거나 팀원들이 실패하는 걸 가만히 보고 있는 것은 꽤나 용기가 필요한 일이기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>보통 우리는 친구들끼리 있는 술자리에서 이런 종류의 한탄아닌 한탄을 많이 한다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>우리 대표는 너무 디테일한 것까지 마이크로매니징을 해서 진짜 피곤해…우리를 못 믿나…? 이럴거면 날 왜 뽑은거래?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>물론 필자도 이 부분에 대해서는 공감이 간다. 일반적으로 CEO는 경영의 전문가이지 제품 개발의 전문가는 아니니 말이다. 솔직히 그 제품을 개발하고 있는 PO, 디자이너, 개발자 입장에서는 전문가도 아닌 사람이 이래라 저래라하는 것이 귀찮고 짜증날 수 있다.</p>\n<p>하지만 잠시만 입장을 바꿔서 생각해보면 그게 오히려 자연스럽고 인간다운 모습이기는 하다. 왜냐면 CEO는 회사가 잘 되었을 때 가장 큰 이익을 챙길 수 있는 사람이기도 하지만, 반대로 망했을 때 가장 큰 리스크를 지는 사람이기도 하기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>일반적으로 스타트업은 투자를 받을 때 투자자로부터 회사의 가치를 평가받고 그 평가된 가치로 주식 1주의 가격을 계산해서 주식을 넘겨주는 형태로 투자를 받는데, 이렇게 투자자들이 스타트업에 투자하는 과정은 우리가 일반적으로 주식을 사고 파는 행위와는 약간 차이가 있다.</p>\n<p>투자자들은 투자에 대한 리스크를 최대한 줄이기 위해 기업이 발행한 채권을 사서 돈을 빌려주고 나중에 채권을 주식으로 바꾸는 방법<small>(CB, 전환사채)</small>을 사용하거나 자신이 원할 때 기업이 주식을 무조건 사줘야하는 조건 또는 꾸준히 배당금을 받겠다는 조건<small>(RCPS, 상환전환우선주)</small>을 걸기도 하고, 지배주주가 지분을 매각할 때 투자자의 주식도 함께 팔아달라고 요구할 수 있는 조항<small>(Tag-along)</small> 등을 적극적으로 사용하기도 하면서 안전장치를 걸어둔다.</p>\n<p>특히 RCPS 같은 우선주를 가진 투자자들은 보통주를 가진 일반주주들보다 여러가지 권리에 대해 우선권을 가지게 되는데, 문제는 CEO도 보통주를 가지고 있다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>그렇기 때문에 우선주를 가지고 있는 투자자가 기업이 망해서 청산당했을 경우 보통주를 가진 주주들보다 잔여재산을 먼저 분배받을 수 있는 권리나 투자자가 계약기간 중 원하는 시점에 기업에게 강제로 주식을 팔 수 있는 권리 등을 행사할 경우에는 기업이 손해를 보더라도 이 권리를 지켜줘야 하는 경우도 발생할 수 있다.</p>\n<p>즉, 스타트업이 받는 투자는 절대 공짜가 아니며, 사업이 잘 안되었을 경우에는 CEO가 보는 금전적 손해 또한 충분히 발생할 수 있다는 것이다. 그리고 다들 아시다시피 이 금액은 한 두푼이 아니다.</p>\n<p>솔직히 이런 상황에서 직원들에게 제품 방향성에 대한 모든 의사결정권을 위임하거나 실패를 용인한다는 결정을 실천하는 것은 결코 쉽지 않다. 아무리 자신의 손으로 뽑은 직원이라고 해도 이 직원이 자신처럼 “내 사업이다”라고 생각할거라는 신뢰를 가지기가 어렵기 때문이다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a

능력을 지니고 있다.</p>\n<p>즉, CEO가 이래라 저래라 하는 것보다 그냥 팀원에게 권한을 위임하고 각자 잘 하는 분야를 맡아서 협업하는 것이 더 효율적이라는 것이다.</p>\n<p>물론 함께 일하다보면 믿었던 팀원이 실패하는 모습들도 보게 될 것이고 이에 실망하는 경우도 있을 수 있다. 하지만 팀원이 저지른 몇 번의 실패 때문에 한번 CEO가 마이크로매니징을 하기 시작하면, 혹여 여러분의 팀원들이 잘 할 수 있는 부분이 있더라도 “어차피 자기 맘대로 할텐데 뭐”라고 생각하며 본인의 능력을 발휘하는 것을 포기하거나, 최악의 경우에는 유능한 직원들이 회사를 떠나는 상황까지도 펼쳐질 수 있다.</p>\n<p>CEO가 사사건건 관여하며 내 능력을 제한하는 회사라면 굳이 여기 있어봤자 재미도 없고 성장도 할 수 없지 않은가?</p>\n<p>이런 상황이 반복되다보면 회사에는 능동적으로 의사결정을 수행하며 자신의 능력을 발휘하는 사람들이 모두 떠나거나, 혹은 수동적으로 변한 상태가 되고, CEO가 일일히 의사결정해주지 않으면 직원들 스스로는 아무것도 결정하지 못 하는 반쪽짜리 조직이 될 수도 있다.</p>\n<p>필자가 지금도 토스의 CEO인 승건님을 대단하다고 생각하는 이유는 단순히 이 분이 일을 잘 해서, 똑똑해서라기보다는 이런 부분을 스스로 인지하고 권한을 위임하는 문화를 본인이 직접 주도해나가고 있다는 점이다.</p>\n<p>아무리 대단한 사람이라고 해도 결국 사람인 이상 사업 실패에 대한 두려움은 당연히 있을텐데, 그런 두려움을 이겨내고 팀원들을 온전히 신뢰하고 권한을 위임하며 실패를 장려하는 문화를 만들어나간다는 것 자체가 일반인 수준의 멘탈리티는 아니라고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>물론 필자가 상기했던 DRI라던가 실패를 자유롭게 경험할 수 있는 환경이라는 토스의 문화는 정답이 아닐수도 있다. 실제로 토스 내에서도 계속 새로운 시도를 하며 문화를 발전시켜나가고 있고 말이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 그 문화가 무엇이던간에 CEO, 즉 리더의 관심없이는 조직 내에 문화가 정착되기 어렵다. 아무리 문화에 관심있는 팀원들이 이리 뛰고 저리 뛰고 해봐도 결국 CEO가 “하지마”라는 말 한마디만 하면 다시 롤백되는 환경이라면 팀원들의 노력이 크게 의미없기도 하고, 어찌어찌 문화를 정착시킨다고 해도 리더부터 그 문화를 지키려는 노력을 하지 않는다면 다른 팀원들도 굳이 그 문화를 지키려고 하지 않게 되기 때문이다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"빠르게-성장한-조직의-문제\" style=\"position:relative;\">빠르게 성장한 조직의 문제<a href=\"#%EB%B9%A0%EB%A5%B4%EA%B2%8C-%EC%84%B1%EC%9E%A5%ED%95%9C-%EC%A1%B0%EC%A7%81%EC%9D%98-%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C\"

프로그램을 통해 훌륭하신 분들을 많이 모실 수 있었지만, 당시 필자는 NEXT Developer를 통해 채용된 몇몇 분들의 행동 패턴이 기존에 있던 사람들과 약간 다르다는 느낌을 받았는데, 대표적으로 차이를 느낀 지점은 대충 이렇다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>왜 대부분 좋다, 괜찮다고만 말씀하시지? 맘에 안 드는 부분이 없으신가?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>저 의견은 근거가 없는 주관적인 의견인데, 왜 그대로 받아들이시지?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>왜 챕터 활동에 적극적으로 참여를 안 하실까?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>사실 이런 특징들은 아직 조직에 적응하지 못한 신규입사자들의 일반적인 특징이기 때문에 크게 이상하지 않다고 생각할 수도 있지만, 이때까지 필자가 경험했던 토스의 신규입사자들은 보통 입사하고 얼마 되지 않았음에도 불구하고 기존의 챕터가 가지고 있던 문제점에 대해 강하게 챌린지를 하거나 사내 라이브러리에 기여를 하는 등 활발한 활동을 하는 경우가 많았다.</p>\n<p>또한 단순히 실력이나 연차의 차이라고 하기도 이상했던 것이, 같은 NEXT Developer 퍼널을 통해서 입사하신 분들 중에서도 저런 행동 패턴을 보이는 분과 아닌 분이 나뉘었다. 그래서 필자는 도대체 어떤 이유로 이런 적극성이나 조직 적응 시간에 대한 차이가 발생하는지에 대한 고민을 했던 것이다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"왜-이-분들은-소극적일까\" style=\"position:relative;\">왜 이 분들은

아닐까 정도로 이야기가 되었었던 걸로 기억한다.</p>\n<p>그래서 당시 챕터에서는 개발자들의 하드 스킬 상향 평준화를 위해 스터디, 오프라인 코드리뷰, 메이트와의 페어프로그래밍 등을 적극적으로 추진했었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 여기에는 함정이 하나 있는데, 이러한 활동들의 기술적 수준이 하드 스킬 능력이 좋은 팀원들에게 맞춰져있는 경우가 많았다는 것이다. 아무래도 지금까지의 프론트엔드 챕터는 모두 함께 성장하는 것을 추구했던 조직이기 때문에 Promise, React와 같이 이미 알고 있는 기초적인 내용보다는 추상화, 대수적 효과처럼 모두가 새롭게 익히고 토론하며 성장할 수 있는 내용들이 선정되기 쉬운 환경이었다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span

채용 프로그램은 처음부터 “주니어”를 뽑겠다고 대놓고 홍보했던 프로그램이었기 때문에 이 퍼널을 통해 입사하신 분들은 실제 본인의 하드 스킬 수준이 어느 정도던 간에 스스로를 아직 실력이 부족한 주니어라고 인지하는 경향이 있었고, 이로 인해 이런 감정을 느끼기 더 쉬운 상황이었다.</p>\n<p>사실 필자도 스터디를 진행할 때까지는 이런 생각을 전혀 못 하고 있다가 나중에 1 on 1 커피챗을 진행하면서 알게 되었는데, 이때부터 필자는 이게 단순히 하드스킬의 차이가 아니라 스스로 느끼는 자신감에 대한 문제라고 생각했다.</p>\n<p>토스팀이 챌린지 문화나 투명한 피드백 문화를 지향하고 있기는 하지만, 사실 이런 것들은 자신이 팀 내에서 최소한 1인분의 역할 정도는 하고 있다는 자신감이 기반이 되어야 행동에 옮길 수 있다. 스스로도 잘 하고 있는지 못 하고 있는지 긴가민가한 상황에서 자신의 의견을 적극적으로 밀어붙히거나 다른 사람에게 피드백을 주는 것은 굉장한 용기를 필요로 하기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>또한 조직에 대한 심리적 안정감에 대한 차이도 있었는데, 예전에는 챕터에 고작 10명 남짓의 인원 밖에 없었고 기술적인 수준도 비슷했기 때문에 서로 빠르게 친해지고 신뢰가 형성되기도 쉬운 환경이었다.</p>\n<p>이렇게 서로가 어떤 성격인지, 일 하는 스타일은 어떤지 잘 알고 있다면 다소 통랄한 피드백을 주고 받더라도 이 사람이 정말로 팀의 발전을 위해 나에게 이런 이야기를 하는 것, 그리고 이 피드백에는 어떠한 감정도 없다는 일종의 확신을 하기가 쉽고, 또 이런 확신이 조직에 대한 심리적 안정감과 신뢰로 이어질 수 있다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a

시작했고, 조직원들의 친밀도는 빠르게 낮아지기 시작했다. <small>(OO님이 누구야? 라는 질문이 점차 많아지던 시절…)</small></p>\n<p>이렇게 낮아진 친밀도는 챕터의 여러 의사결정에 대한 사람들의 참여도에도 좋지 않은 영향을 끼쳤고, 서로에 대해 피드백이나 심지어는 기술적인 의견을 자유롭게 주고 받는 문화도 점차 흐려지게 되었다. 그리고 이런 현상은 앞서 이야기했던 주니어 세그먼트에서 더 잦게 발생하고 있었다.</p>\n<p>처음에는 챕터 내에서도 “그래도 예전같은 분위기를 만들기 위해 해볼 수 있는 것은 다 해봐야한다”라는 회귀파의 여론이 강했지만, 점차 시간이 흐르고 인원이 더 늘어나게 되자 현실을 인정하고 현재 챕터의 규모에 맞는 방법을 찾아야한다는 현실파 쪽으로 기울기 시작했다.</p>\n<p>그 당시 필자는 처음부터 현실파 쪽에 가까웠는데, 필자가 강하게 주장했던 것은 모두 같은 나이, 비슷한 수준을 가지고 있는 학생 때도 40명 밖에 안 되는 같은 반 친구들조차 전부 친하게 지내지 못 하는데, 인원도 더 많고 하드스킬 수준에 따라 위계가 생겨버린 현재의 프론트엔드 챕터에서 어떻게 예전 같은 친밀도가 형성되기를 기대하냐는 것이었다.</p>\n<p>즉, 이제 프론트엔드 챕터는 고작 10명 남짓으로 구성된 조직의 규모가 아닌 60명이 넘는 조직에서의 친밀도를 높히고 조직에 대한 심리적 안정감을 만들어낼 수 있는 새로운 방법을 강구해야했다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"

어려운 상황이었다.</p>\n<p>그런 이유로 지금까지의 프론트엔드 챕터는 챕터 단위로 의사결정을 내리고 액션아이템을 실천하고 있었지만, 챕터의 인원이 급격하게 늘어나며 조직의 밀도가 낮아지다보니 이제 프론트엔드 쪽에도 챕터 리드보다 더 가까이서 팀원들을 도와줄 수 있는 역할이 필요해졌던 것이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 처음에는 T-Lead를 오마쥬한 F-Lead라는 이름의 역할을 만드려고 했었지만 아무래도 Lead라는 단어가 오히려 위계를 더 강화시킬 수 있다는 걱정도 들었고, 프론트엔드 챕터가 생각하는 리드의 역할은 다른 사람들을 관리하는 사람이 아니라 팀원들을 도와주는 사람이었기 때문에, 이름에서부터 이런 느낌이 강하게 드러났으면 좋겠다는 의견이 많았다.</p>\n<p>즉, 다른 사일로를 지원해야하는 업무처럼 약간 Gray한 영역에 있는 일들이나 조직 개편같은 행정적인 일 혹은 1 on 1 커피챗을 통한 고민 상담 등을 수행하며 팀원들이 일에 더 집중할 수 있는 환경을 만들어주고, 프론트엔드 챕터의 인원들이 빠르게 성장할 수 있게 도와줌으로써 챕터 전체의 하드스킬과 소프트스킬을 상향평준화시키는 일종의 도우미같은 역할을 기대한 것이다. <small>(그러면서 자기 사일로 업무도 다 해내야한…읍읍)</small></p>\n<p>이런저런 아이데이션을 통해 재미있는 이름들이 많이 나왔지만 최종적으로는 F-Evangelist라는 이름의 역할이 탄생하게 되었고, 챕터의 문화나 심리적 안정감에 관심이 많았던 필자도 어쩌다보니 이 역할을 맡게 되었다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"내가-싼-똥-자랑하기\"

있는 환경이 우선적으로 마련되어야 프론트엔드 챕터가 발전할 수 있다고 생각했었기 때문에, 처음 소그룹과 F-Evangelist가 등장했을 때부터 조직 내 친밀도를 높혀 사람들이 프론트엔드 챕터라는 조직 안에서 심리적 안정감을 느낄 수 있게 만드는 것에 집중해야한다는 의견을 꾸준히 밀었다.</p>\n<p>당시 필자가 생각했던 최우선 과제는 필자의 그룹에 있는 주니어 구성원들이 자신보다 연차가 많은 개발자나 F-Evangelist와 같이 특정한 역할을 맡고 있는 개발자를 어려운 사람이 아닌 그냥 한 명의 동료 개발자로 느끼도록 만드는 것이었다.</p>\n<p>아무리 위계를 만들기 싫다는 이유로 역할의 이름에서 리드라는 단어를 제거하기는 했지만, 실질적으로 하는 행동들을 보면 리드나 다름없기 때문에 이름 변경과 같은 소극적인 액션만으로 다른 사람들이 이 역할에 대해 느끼는 거리감이나 위계감이 완전히 제거되는 것을 바라는 것은 무리라고 생각했다.</p>\n<p>게다가 토스 프론트엔드 챕터에는 여러가지 활동을 통해 네임 밸류가 쌓여있는 개발자들도 여럿 있었고, 주니어 분들은 네임 밸류가 높으면 막연하게 실력도 좋을 것이라고 생각하는 경향이 있었다. 필자는 안 그래도 하드 스킬에 대한 편차로 인해 위계가 발생하는 상황에서 이런 네임 밸류에 대한 오해까지 덧붙혀지면 조직 내 심리적 안정감을 만드는데 큰 방해가 될 것이라고 판단했기 때문에 이런 생각을 완전히 제거하고 싶었다. <small>(유명한 것과 개발 잘 하는 것은 크게 상관관계가 없다)</small></p>\n<p>그래서 필자가 가장 처음 했던 것은 바로 “똥 자랑 대회”였다.</p>\n<p>일반적으로 개발자들은 아름다운 설계를 지향하지만 회사에서 개발을 하다보면 비즈니스 상황과 같은 외부 요인으로 인해 설계를 뭉개고 가는 경우도 있으며 바쁜 일정으로 인해 서두르다 버그를 내는 경우도 흔하다.</p>\n<p>이런 상황에서 제대로 설계하지 않은 코드를 짜는 행위나 실수를 “똥을 쌌다”라고 표현하고는 하는데, 필자는 바로 이런 코드들을 서로 공유해보자고 제안했던 것이다. 물론 다소 캐쥬얼하기도 하고 더러운 이름이기는 하지만, 필자는 모두가 웃고 즐기며 실수를 편하게 공개할 수 있는 자리를 원했기 때문에 일부러 “부채 공유하기”나 “회고”와 같은 딱딱한 이름이 아닌 재미있는 이름을 선정했다.</p>\n<p>필자의 그룹에는 토스가 완전 첫 직장인 신입 개발자부터 연차가 6-7년 정도 되는 개발자까지 다양한 세그먼트들이 분포해있었는데, 똥 자랑 대회를 진행함으로써 연차와 상관없이 개발자라면 누구나 다 실수를 할 수 있고 설계를 뭉개는 상황도 발생한다는 것을 알림과 동시에, 경험이 많은 개발자들이 이런 똥을 어떻게 치워나가는지, 그리고 어떤 사고 과정을 통해 설계를 뭉개서라도 속도를 챙기겠다는 의사결정까지 다다르는지와 같은 경험을 공유하는 것을 의도했다.</p>\n<p>그러나 필자는 여기서도 한 가지 실수를 했는데, 하드스킬 수준에 따라서 스스로 똥이라고 생각하는 코드가 달랐던 것이다. 물론 상대적으로 해결 난이도가 낮은 똥에 대해서는 활발한 토론이 이루어졌고 문제 해결 방식도 제안되었지만, 하드스킬이 부족하다면 이해하는 것 자체가 어려운 똥에 대해서는 하드스킬 수준에 따라 참여도가 극명하게 갈렸다.</p>\n<p>이 문제는 이미 이전에 진행했던 스터디나 오프라인 코드리뷰 등에서 발생했던 문제였지만, 처음 F-Evangelist를 맡았을 때의 필자는 얼른 심리적 위계를 제거하고 싶다는 마음만 앞서서 지난 실패에서 얻었던 경험을 잊어버리고 만 것이다.</p>\n<p>사실 똥 자랑 대회에 대한 사람들의 후기는 나쁘지 않았지만, 필자가 원래 의도했던 심리적 위계를 제거하는 행위까지는 다다르지 못 한채로 첫 번째 액션아이템을 마무리하게 되었다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"강점찾기\" style=\"position:relative;\">강점찾기<a href=\"#%EA%B0%95%EC%A0%90%EC%B0%BE%EA%B8%B0\" aria-label=\"강점찾기 permalink\"

아닌 사람 대 사람으로써 친해질 수 있는 정보를 쌓아보자는 방식을 밀어보게되었다.</p>\n<p>그래서 주말에 할 거 없는 사람들끼리 모여서 이쁜 카페에 가서 맛있는 것도 먹고 개인 작업도 하는 모각코 자리를 마련하거나 소그룹 위클리 미팅 시간을 잡담 타임으로 활용하는 등 여러가지 액션아이템을 계속 반복해서 수행하고 사람들의 반응을 관찰했다. 이렇게 몇 번의 액션아이템을 반복하다보니, 그룹 내에는 확실히 이전에 비해 친밀도가 형성되었고 이에 대한 조직 내 심리적 안정감도 형성되었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 아직 필자가 해결하지 못 했던 이슈는 주니어 개발자 분들이 가지고 있는 “나는 아직 부족해”라는 부담감이었다. 물론 이러한 부담감이 건강하게 작용한다면 성장에 대한 훌륭한 동기 부여가 될 수 있었지만, 이런 생각이 너무 과해진다면 오히려 자신감이나 자존감 하락으로 이어져서 독이 될 수도 있다.</p>\n<p>그러던 와중 필자는 같은 사일로의 디자이너 분이 어떤 스프레드시트를 보고 있는 것을 발견했는데, 그 시트는 바로 디자인 챕터에서 진행했었던 “강점찾기”라는 테스트의 결과지였다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span

<small>이 책을 사면 인터넷에서 강점찾기 테스트를 할 수 있는 코드를 준다</small>\n</center>\n<p>필자는 이런 종류의 테스트는 전혀 믿지 않는 편이라 처음에는 그냥 “디자인 챕터에서 또 재밌는 거 했네” 정도로 생각하고 넘어가려고 했으나, 이내 곧 이 테스트가 사람들의 부담감을 덜어줄 수 있는 좋은 메소드가 될 수도 있겠다는 생각이 들었다. <small>(디자인 챕터가 은근히 이런 재밌는 걸 많이 한다)</small></p>\n<p>성장에는 크게 두 가지 방법이 있는데, 한 가지는 내가 못하는 것을 더 잘하게 만드는 것이고, 다른 한 가지는 내가 이미 잘 하고 있는 부분을 더 잘하게 만드는 방법이다. 하지만 일반적으로 한창 성장하는 시기의 개발자들은 자신이 이미 잘 하고 있는 것보다 자신이 못 하는 것에만 집중하고 그 부분을 채우려고 하는 성향이 크다.</p>\n<p>비록 자신이 못 하는 것에 집중하고 보완하는 것이 좋은 성장의 방법이기는 하지만, 자칫 “난 이걸 못해”라는 부정적인 생각에 너무 빠지다보면 스스로를 너무 몰아세워 건강을 해치면서까지 공부나 일을 한다거나, 주변의 개발자들과 자신을 비교하며 좌절하는 상황도 발생할 수 있다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 강점찾기라는 테스트를 통해서 사람들이 스스로 “자신이 잘 하는 것이 무엇인지”를 알 수 있도록 메타인지를 심어주면, 자신의 약점에만 집중하는 것이 아닌 강점과 약점을 모두 알게 되면서 스스로에 대한 자신감도 생기지 않을까하는 생각을 했던 것이다.</p>\n<p>이후 이 생각에 대해 다른 프론트엔드 개발자 분들에게 이야기를 했는데, 이에 공감해주시는 두 분이 조인하여 우리끼리 강점찾기를 한번 직접 진행해보기로 했다. 이때 디자인 플랫폼팀 소속인 프론트엔드 개발자 분은 이미 디자인 챕터와 함께 강점찾기를 진행해보신 경험이 있었기 때문에, 당시의 경험을 살려 프론트엔드 챕터에 맞는 방식을 찾아나가는 과정에 큰 도움을 주셨다.</p>\n<p>강점찾기 프로그램을 진행하는 방법은 굉장히 심플했는데, 그냥 회사에 요청을 해서 책을 구매한 뒤 각자 테스트를 진행하고 PDF로 나온 테스트 결과지를 다시 강점찾기 슬랙 채널에 공유하면, 이후 오프라인으로 모여서 진행자가 각자의 결과지를 해설해주는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이때 진행자는 팀원들의 강점 결과를 단순히 읽어주기보다는 강점찾기에 참여한 팀원들이 서로의 강점에 대해서 공감하고 기억할 수 있는 환경을 만들어주는 역할을 하는데, 진행자의 액션아이템은 대략 이런 느낌이었다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>결과지를 단순히 읽어주는 것이 아니라, 실제로 토스팀에서 경험해볼 수 있는 상황들을 예를 들어주는 것이 좋다.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>팀원들의 강점을 한 줄로 요약 정리해서 다른 사람들이 기억하기 쉽도록 만들어주자.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>내 강점 중 다른 사람들이 더 관심을 가져줬으면 하는 부분에 하이라이팅을 하도록 시키자.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>서로의 강점을 더욱 더 강화시킬 수 있는 액션아이템을 정해주도록 시키자.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>강점찾기의 목적에는 스스로 무엇을 잘 하는지에 대한 메타인지를 키우도록 하는 것도 있었지만, 하나의 팀으로 일을 한다는 것이 얼마나 다양한 강점을 가진 사람들이 모여 시너지를 만드는 과정인지 알려주는 것도 있었기 때문에, 단순히 스스로 강점을 알고 끝나는 것이 아니라 적극적으로 서로의 강점을 인지하고 더 강화시키기 위한 활동도 추가적으로 진행했다.</p>\n<p>이렇게 강점찾기에 대한 PoC를 진행해보니 생각보다 각자의 강점에 대해서 상세하게 설명해주기도 하고 재미도 있어서, 곧 필자가 리딩하고 있는 소그룹에서도 강점찾기를 진행해보았다.</p>\n<p>그 당시 필자는 팀원들이 이 프로그램을 업무의 일환이라고 느끼게 만들고 싶지 않았기도 했고, 어차피 개발과 조금 동떨어진 느낌의 프로그램을 진행하는 김에 아예 하루 일탈하는 기분도 내기를 바라서 사무실이 아닌 충무로에 있는 이쁜 카페에 모여서 강점찾기 프로그램을 진행했다.</p>\n<p>결과는 생각보다 좋았다. 솔직히 이런 테스트에는 어떠한 과학적 근거도 없으니 사람들이 믿지 않을 수도 있기 때문에 큰 기대는 하지 않았지만, 생각보다 다들 자신의 강점을 알아보며 기뻐해주셨고, 좋은 개발자라는 것이 한 가지 모습이 아니라 여러 가지 모습이라는 것, 프론트엔드 챕터는 다양한 강점을 가진 사람들이 모여서 시너지를 만들어내야하는 팀이라는 것들에 크게 공감해주셨다.</p>\n<p>물론 필자는 커피챗 등을 통해 팀원들에게 이런 이야기들을 많이 해줬었지만, 백 마디 말보다 이런 프로그램이나 캠페인을 한 번 진행하는 것이 더 효과가 좋다는 점에 큰 감명을 받았다.</p>\n<p>이후 소그룹에서 좋은 결과를 얻었던 필자는 F-Evangelist 미팅에서 강점찾기의 목적과 방법을 설명하며 전도하기 시작했다. 원래 목적은 토스 코어에서 우선 테스트해보고 반응이 좋으면 다른 계열사로 수출하는 그림을 그렸었는데, 강점찾기 채널을 눈팅하고 있던 다른 계열사 프론트엔드 개발자 분들이 강점찾기를 알아서 퍼나르기 시작하면서 갑자기 강점찾기를 수출당해버렸다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a

조직에 대한 만족도가 높았던 것 같다. <small>(지나고 나서 보니 뭔가 멋진 대사인듯…?)</small></p>\n<p>이제 토스는 필자가 입사했을 당시의 300명짜리 스타트업이 아니라 2,000명 규모의 머기업이 되어버렸다. 그러니 당연히 그 시절의 토스와는 달라진 부분들이 있고, 필자는 그 부분에서 묘한 향수감과 아쉬움을 느끼고 있기는 하다. 예전에는 챕터든 사일로든 진짜 친한 친구들이랑 으쌰으쌰 일 하는 느낌이었다면, 최근에는 조금 더 회사원 같아진 느낌이랄까.</p>\n<p>하지만 이제 토스는 예전의 모습으로 돌아갈 수는 없을 것이다. 300명짜리 문화와 2,000명짜리 문화는 당연히 다를 수 밖에 없기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 이번에 작은 스타트업으로 이직을 하면서, 업무에 몰입하여 미친 생산성을 만들어내는, 예전에 필자가 사랑했던 그 문화를 직접 만들어내어 제품을 성공의 길로 이끌어내는 경험을 해보고 싶었다.</p>\n<p>필자가 이직한 쿼타랩이라는 스타트업에서도 역시 <a href=\"https://quotalab.career.greetinghr.com/o/61278\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">프론트엔드 개발자를 절찬리 채용 중</a>이니, 이 글을 읽는 독자분들 중에서도 혹시 이런 미친 생산성을 만들어내는 문화를 조직에 도입하고 그 문화를 기반으로 제품을 성공시키는 경험을 해보고 싶으신 분들이 있다면 지원해주셨으면 한다. <small>(IT는 진짜 인재밀도랑 문화가 다 해먹는다)</small></p>","fields":{"slug":"20220507-toss-retrospective","path":"/2022/05/07/toss-retrospective/","lang":"ko"},"frontmatter":{"title":"토스에서 일하며 깨달은 성장과 리더십","subTitle":"자율과 책임이 주어진 환경, 나는 어떻게
