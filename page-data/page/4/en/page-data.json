It’s only natural for improved paradigms to emerge over time.</p>\n<p>Personally, I still think OOP is a solid design paradigm. But you might find Functional Programming more efficient and appealing — and that’s completely fine.</p>\n<p>Choosing which paradigm you prefer is a matter of personal freedom. But making good choices requires understanding the trade-offs — what you gain and what you lose — which means even if you choose FP, you still need to understand what OOP is.</p>\n<p>Moreover, OOP has played a crucial role in modern program design from the early 1990s through today. No matter how much attention newer paradigms receive, the fact remains that OOP underpins the design of most programs out there — and that’s one very practical reason to learn it, whether you love it or not. <small>(Major languages like Java, Python, and C++ all support OOP.)</small></p>\n<p>So in this post, let’s take a quick look at what OOP aims to achieve and what concepts make it tick.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-object-oriented-mean\" style=\"position:relative;\">What Does “Object-Oriented” Mean?<a href=\"#what-does-object-oriented-mean\" aria-label=\"what does object oriented mean permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>If you translate “Object-Oriented” literally, you get something like “directed toward objects.” The “objects” here refer to independent entities that exist in the real world. This is usually the very first concept you encounter when learning OOP. It’s actually quite simple once you understand it, but since it’s not something we consciously think about in daily life, it can feel confusing at first.</p>\n<p>To explain objects, we need to introduce the concept of classes as well. The terminology isn’t the most intuitive, but the underlying idea is something anyone can grasp. Most tutorials use the cookie-cutter-and-cookie analogy, but instead of starting with “a class is X, an object is Y,” I’d rather begin with OOP’s broader design concept and let things fall into place naturally.</p>\n<p>Let’s set aside the dry terminology for now and just follow along with an example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"classes-and-objects\" style=\"position:relative;\">Classes and Objects<a href=\"#classes-and-objects\" aria-label=\"classes and objects permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>At the top of this post, I said OOP is about reflecting the real world in program design. Once you understand what that means, concepts like classes and objects will click naturally. So let’s first explore <em>why</em> OOP is called a design approach that mirrors reality.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of examples we could use, but everyday objects tend to resonate best. I’ll use smartphones as my example. Since I use an iPhone 7 made by Apple, let’s start there.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/b4294/iphone7.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"iphone7\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/b4294/iphone7.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/0913d/iphone7.jpg 160w,\n/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/cb69c/iphone7.jpg 320w,\n/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/b4294/iphone7.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>If we wanted to model the iPhone 7 as a program, we’d first need to define what an iPhone 7 actually <em>is</em>.

The concepts like iPhone 7 and iPhone are what we call <strong>classes</strong>.</p>\n<p>And the act of creating these higher-level concepts? That’s called <strong>abstraction</strong>. I’ll explain abstraction in more detail shortly — for now, just remember the concept of classes.</p>\n<p>So what’s an <strong>object</strong>? Notice how many times I used the word “concept” when explaining classes. That’s exactly what a class is — it represents a concept. But a concept alone can’t become a tangible thing in reality.</p>\n<p>Think about it: “iPhone 7” is just the name of a product line. It’s not a specific, unique physical item. By “unique,” I mean unique at the level of “only one exists in the entire world.” My iPhone 7 and your iPhone 7 are actually different iPhone 7s, aren’t they?</p>\n<p>In other words, the iPhone 7 class has no tangible existence on its own. The class defines specs like CPU, display resolution, and memory. A factory uses these specs to produce an <em>actual</em> iPhone 7, assigns it a serial number, and ships it. Only then do we have a physical iPhone 7 we can hold in our hands.</p>\n<p>That produced iPhone 7 has a unique serial number, so we know there’s only one iPhone 7 in the world with serial number <code class=\"language-text\">1234</code>.</p>\n<p>These produced iPhone 7s are what we call <strong>objects</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short, a class is a blueprint, and you need to use it to create an actual, usable thing. An object is the real thing created from a class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This OOP design approach lets us abstract most concepts from our daily lives. It’s actually fun to practice abstracting everything you see around you. A few examples:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Sonata → Midsize Sedan → Sedan → Car → Vehicle</li>\n<li>Evan Moon → Male → Human → Primate → Mammal → Animal</li>\n<li>Overwatch → FPS Game → Game → Software</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Almost every concept in our daily lives can be organized through this kind of abstraction. Practicing this with everyday objects is a great exercise you can do anytime — once you get the hang of it, you can sit in a café drinking coffee and mentally model the entire café as a program.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, “object-oriented” means starting from the ability to represent everything in the real world by defining abstract concepts as classes and creating usable objects from those classes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lets-think-about-abstraction-more-deeply\" style=\"position:relative;\">Let’s Think About Abstraction More Deeply<a href=\"#lets-think-about-abstraction-more-deeply\" aria-label=\"lets think about abstraction more deeply permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>We just walked through a simple abstraction exercise starting from iPhone 7 and working upward. But you probably didn’t have to think very hard, because concepts like iPhone and smartphone are already deeply familiar. They were already somewhat abstracted and organized in your mind.</p>\n<p>In real program design, however, you often need to define the concepts from scratch — they’re not always familiar everyday things. If you don’t precisely understand what abstraction is, you risk designing classes in strange directions. So let’s nail this down.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the word “abstraction” itself. Abstraction means identifying and capturing specific attributes from the many attributes an entity possesses. Looking at how Picasso progressively abstracted a bull in his famous series of lithographs gives a nice visual of what abstraction is:</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 488px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/155ab/picasso_bull.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 94.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"picasso bull\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/155ab/picasso_bull.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/0913d/picasso_bull.jpg 160w,\n/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/cb69c/picasso_bull.jpg 320w,\n/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/155ab/picasso_bull.jpg 488w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Picasso's progressive abstraction of a bull</small>\n</center>\n<p>Abstraction is about identifying the most characteristic attributes of something.</p>\n<p>When we derived “iPhone” from “iPhone 7,” the process felt quite intuitive. But if you always approach abstraction that intuitively, it actually becomes harder to stay on track. The proper approach is to look at all the iPhone models and identify their <em>common</em> traits first, then use those to create the parent concept. The attributes of a properly abstracted parent concept will be universally applicable to all its children.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Parent concept</strong><br />\niPhone: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Child concepts based on the iPhone class</strong><br />\niPhone X: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple, with no home button and a bezel-less design.<br />\niPhone 7: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple, with a home button featuring a built-in haptic engine.<br />\niPhone SE: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple, compact enough to hold comfortably in one hand.<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As this example shows, child concepts inherit all the attributes of the parent concept — which is why this process is called <strong>inheritance</strong>. I’ll cover inheritance in more detail below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-big-three-of-oop\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Big Three of OOP<a href=\"#the-big-three-of-oop\" aria-label=\"the big three of oop permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>The concepts of classes, objects, and abstraction that we just covered are the foundations of OOP. Now I want to go a step further and explain a few more concepts that OOP-supporting languages provide. OOP programs are designed by assembling classes and objects, and these additional concepts exist to make that assembly smoother.</p>\n<p>Some of these concepts aren’t implemented in JavaScript, so I’ll use Java for the examples. The syntax differences are minor enough at a glance that JavaScript developers should have no trouble following along. TypeScript does support OOP as well, but setting it up is more hassle than just compiling Java, so Java it is.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a quick look at the “Big Three” of OOP: inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inheritance\" style=\"position:relative;\">Inheritance<a href=\"#inheritance\" aria-label=\"inheritance permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Inheritance is the concept I briefly touched on when explaining abstraction. In many OOP languages, inheritance is expressed with the <code class=\"language-text\">extends</code> keyword. From the child’s perspective, it’s inheriting the parent’s attributes; from the parent’s perspective, its attributes are being extended into the child — hence <code class=\"language-text\">extends</code>. Let’s see how it works in code.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-java line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> manufacturer <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"apple\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> os <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"iOS\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Main</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">void</span> main <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token class-name\">String</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> args<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span> myIPhone7 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">System</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>out<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">println</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myIPhone7<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>manufacturer<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">System</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>out<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">println</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myIPhone7<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>os<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">System</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>out<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">println</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myIPhone7<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>version<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">apple\niOS\n7</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>When creating the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone7</code> class, we used <code class=\"language-text\">extends</code> to inherit from <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code>. Even though <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone7</code> doesn’t explicitly declare <code class=\"language-text\">manufacturer</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">os</code>, it inherits those attributes from its parent class <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we need to create an <code class=\"language-text\">IPhoneX</code> class, we can reuse the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code> class directly:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-java line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhoneX</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>In other words, if you’ve built a well-abstracted class, you can reuse it whenever you need another class with similar attributes. And if a change applies across the entire iPhone series, you only need to modify the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code> class — all child classes inherit the change automatically. This shortens development time and reduces the chance of human error.</p>\n<p>But what if requirements change and you now need to model the Galaxy series? Galaxy phones use Android instead of iOS and are made by Samsung, not Apple — so we can’t reuse the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code> class. We could just create a separate <code class=\"language-text\">Galaxy</code> class, but we could also go one level higher and create a <code class=\"language-text\">SmartPhone</code> class:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-java line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> manufacturer<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> os<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>manufacturer <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> manufacturer<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>os <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> os<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"apple\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"iOS\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Galaxy</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">Galaxy</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"samsung\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"android\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">GalaxyS10</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Galaxy</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"s10\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">super</code> method calls the parent class’s constructor. Parent classes are also called “super classes” and child classes “sub classes” — hence the <code class=\"language-text\">super</code> keyword.</p>\n<p>Child classes like <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone7</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">GalaxyS10</code> can also override the parent’s <code class=\"language-text\">manufacturer</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">os</code> attributes — this is called <strong>overriding</strong>. If you’ve done Android development, you’ve seen the <code class=\"language-text\">@Override</code> decorator constantly — it’s the same mechanism.</p>\n<p>This class dependency structure improves class reusability, but if inheritance hierarchies become too complex, they become difficult to understand. It’s important to design inheritance with clear intent and reasonable depth. <small>(Though what counts as “reasonable” varies from developer to developer — that’s the catch.)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"encapsulation\" style=\"position:relative;\">Encapsulation<a href=\"#encapsulation\" aria-label=\"encapsulation permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Encapsulation means hiding a class’s internal workings so that users of the class only need to know <em>how</em> to use it, not <em>how it works inside</em>.</p>\n<p>By encapsulating a class, consumers don’t need to puzzle over internal logic.

Polymorphism is the concept that rescues us from exactly this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>Remember: I defined polymorphism as “a single variable or method name being interpreted differently depending on the context.” So if we unify all hero ultimate methods under the name <code class=\"language-text\">ultimate</code> but have each hero execute different code when it’s called — that’s polymorphism.</p>\n<p>We could manually add an <code class=\"language-text\">ultimate</code> method to each hero class that extends <code class=\"language-text\">Hero</code>, but that leaves room for developer error. <small>(Typos being the most common offender.)</small> So Java provides features that <em>force</em> developers to implement certain methods.</p>\n<p>Those features are <strong>abstract classes</strong> and <strong>interfaces</strong>. As I mentioned, I’ll only use abstract classes here.</p>\n<p>For the curious: in brief, abstract classes are for extending an existing class’s functionality, while interfaces define a pure contract with no implementation. Interfaces can’t contain method implementations, but abstract classes can. <small>(Since Java 8, interfaces can have <code class=\"language-text\">default</code> methods with implementations — blurring the distinction further.)</small></p>\n<p>Our <code class=\"language-text\">Hero</code> class receives a <code class=\"language-text\">name</code> from the constructor and stores it — so an abstract class is the better fit.

Don’t confuse this with <em>overriding</em>, which I mentioned briefly in the inheritance section.</p>\n<p>Overriding replaces a parent class’s member variable or method. Overloading lets you use the same method name for different behaviors depending on the arguments — it’s a polymorphism feature. <small>(I used to mix these up on exams all the time.)</small></p>\n<p>Overloading is a straightforward concept, but it can be surprising for developers who primarily use languages like JavaScript or Python that don’t support it. The reason: overloading means “calling a completely different method based on what arguments you pass — even though the method name is identical.”</p>\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/3abde762b5e8eea7abbf6e856bc86e9e/dog_voice.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n  <small>Wait, what?</small>\n</center>\n<p>Imagine a class with a <code class=\"language-text\">sum</code> method that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

If you studied computer science — or even took a CS elective — you’ve almost certainly encountered OOP in a university course.</p>\n<p>The audience I’m writing for is people who recently learned to code at a bootcamp or similar program. From what I’ve seen, unless the curriculum is Java-based, bootcamps rarely cover OOP in any meaningful way.</p>\n<p>It’s understandable — bootcamps aim to get students job-ready in a short time, which means prioritizing practical skills. But OOP isn’t a Java-only concept; it’s a universal programming paradigm applicable to any language, so it’s a shame when it gets skipped.</p>\n<p>To be clear: I’m not saying “OOP is great, therefore you must learn it.” As I mentioned at the top, the world’s most popular languages — Java, Python, C++ — are either designed around OOP or fully support it. If you’re writing code today, you need to understand OOP whether you personally love it or not.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/7ca1f/language_index.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 41.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA6ElEQVR42nWS6RKDIAyEff8X9RwVjwJeqV86oYzT/thxIZtlAxbOOZmmSbZtk77vZVmWxGOMQr3rOhmGQcZx1Nq+7+K9l7Isdc0+9eM4pKDpPE8tADZpuK5L+bquukYD4IC+qqrSoYCeIoSgAsw49cOjhPBSA4SkNo0Z0tc0jfJ5nnVK9GpIEsRfHiXehnDEeXIA5/C2bZMmGVJgk+jGLeFxCxDSyPdpWNe1cmpMooYY/U7o08gY2tXkI+cJwf+ENw9+VYG97nNkDC0hdaCPYiZ2qr7knZY7RODcqCOhyUEAfif0docYvgE1GW9g4T9oMQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"language index\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/6af66/language_index.png\" srcset=\"/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/69538/language_index.png 160w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/72799/language_index.png 320w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/6af66/language_index.png 640w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/d9199/language_index.png 960w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/21b4d/language_index.png 1280w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/7ca1f/language_index.png 1890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    TIOBE language rankings, August 2019<br>\n    Every language in the top ranks except C, JavaScript, and SQL uses OOP.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>There’s no single right answer among programming paradigms.

These concepts are actually closer to logic than to math, so you don’t need to think of them purely in terms of numbers.</p>\n<p>These are concepts we already learned in middle and high school. We just forgot them because there wasn’t much use for them after standardized tests. Those who majored in STEM or math-heavy fields like economics might still remember, but for everyone else, forgetting is only natural.</p>\n<p>These are all logic concepts you’ve encountered at least once as a kid, so let’s approach them with a light heart.</p>\n<h3 id=\"propositions\" style=\"position:relative;\">Propositions<a href=\"#propositions\" aria-label=\"propositions permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The first concept is propositions — something we learned in middle school. Propositions aren’t just useful for programming; they’re fundamental to logical thinking in general.</p>\n<p>A proposition is a statement that has a logical truth value — true or false. Statements where truth and falsehood can’t be determined don’t count as propositions. “Gildong is tall” isn’t a proposition because tallness is subjective — someone might think he’s tall, someone else might not.</p>\n<p>So where do propositions show up in programming?</p>\n<p>The true and false of propositions are the exact same concept as <code class=\"language-text\">True</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">False</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">1</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> in programming. In other words, the propositions we learned from math textbooks in middle school are equivalent to conditional expressions. Let’s look at a simple example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> array <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'a'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'b'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'c'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>array<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">includes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'a'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'The array variable contains a.'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'The array variable does not contain a.'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The proposition I’ve presented here is “the array stored in the <code class=\"language-text\">array</code> variable contains the element <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>.” If this proposition is true, the code inside the <code class=\"language-text\">if</code> block executes; if false, the <code class=\"language-text\">else</code> block runs. Since conditions used in conditional statements must be propositions, a developer comfortable with propositions can quickly formulate the right conditions when hearing a requirement.</p>\n<p>Propositions are the most fundamental concept underlying everything else I’ll discuss — and all other mathematical concepts too. That’s why we learn them at the very start of middle school. Mathematics isn’t a wishy-washy discipline; it requires the ability to ask precise questions and provide precise answers, which is why propositions form its foundation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sets\" style=\"position:relative;\">Sets<a href=\"#sets\" aria-label=\"sets permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Next up is sets, also learned in middle school. Like propositions, sets are used constantly in programming without us always realizing it — so having a solid understanding of them is genuinely helpful.</p>\n<p>Those cute round Venn diagrams might seem far removed from programming, but we actually use the concept every single day — when writing logical expressions. A logical expression, like a proposition, evaluates to either <code class=\"language-text\">True</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">False</code>. We typically combine multiple propositions using logical operators. So what do logical expressions have to do with sets?</p>\n<p>The logical operators we use map directly to set operations: <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;&amp; (AND) = intersection</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">|| (OR) = union</code>. This means that when you encounter a complex logical expression, you can draw it as a Venn diagram. And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">De Morgan’s laws</a>, which we memorized as kids, apply directly to logical expressions too. <small>(De Morgan’s laws are actually more broadly a law of logic than strictly about sets.)</small></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;

Before diving into what mathematical induction is, we need to understand the two main types of logical reasoning: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.</p>\n<p>Simply put, inductive reasoning feels like “it’s been this way so far, so it’ll continue to be this way,” while deductive reasoning feels like “if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.” I’ll keep this brief with simple examples.</p>\n<p>Inductive reasoning goes like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The summer of 2000 was hot. The summer of 2001 was hot… The summer of 2019 was hot. <strong>Therefore, summers are always hot.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if every premise is true, the conclusion isn’t guaranteed to be true. In the example above, couldn’t an extreme weather event bring snow in the summer of 2020? <small>(The Day After Tomorrow…?)</small></p>\n<p>In other words, inductive reasoning always carries a probability of error. It might seem full of holes, but modern science has advanced through inductive reasoning — continuously proposing and proving hypotheses — so it’s quite valuable.</p>\n<p>Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, goes like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MacBooks are made by Apple. My computer is a MacBook. <strong>Therefore, my computer was made by Apple.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a syllogism — the most classic example of deductive reasoning. This is what “if certain premises are true, the conclusion must be true” means. If the conclusion is false, at least one premise must also be false. Deductive reasoning excels at proving what’s already contained in the premises, but unlike inductive reasoning, it’s not suited for exploring new knowledge.</p>\n<p>In programming, we’re not exploring new knowledge — we’re trying to prove our code is correct and error-free.

But think about it: even those who thought they didn’t know this stuff were probably using all of these concepts unconsciously. They just hadn’t formalized them as theory.</p>\n<p>And I think the best thing about learning math is that when you want to build something, at least the theory won’t be what stops you.</p>\n<p>Looking at posts I’ve written before, like <a href=\"/2017/05/03/calculate-orbit-2\">calculating planetary orbits</a> or <a href=\"/2018/07/19/deep-learning-backpropagation\">the backpropagation algorithm</a>, they might look intimidating with all the equations. When I first built those projects, the math I’d learned in school was already hazy, so I essentially studied it all over again from scratch — and eventually completed those projects.</p>\n<p>Theories with terrifying names like linear algebra, Euler rotations, and quaternions were certainly daunting at first. But by keeping at the documentation even when I didn’t understand, writing code for the parts I could grasp, and running it line by line to see the mechanics with my own eyes — at some point, things started becoming much more familiar.</p>\n<p>Math isn’t as scary as it seems. Just like that neural network equation looked complex and intimidating at first glance but turned out to be straightforward once translated to code. As developers, mathematical and logical concepts are already ingrained in us whether we know it or not — so isn’t it a bit silly to be afraid of math at this point?

The most dangerous thing about gambling is the hope that “sure, I lost this round, but I could win the next one!” — and that hope stems from the belief that gambling games are fundamentally based on randomness. In other words, there has to be a significant element of luck involved.</p>\n<p>The thing is, I don’t know much about actual gambling games, so let me use something lighter as an example — a coin-flipping game. Imagine placing coins on a thick book, then slapping the book to try to flip them. The idea is that whoever flips all the coins to show the same face wins the pot. It’s hard to calculate exactly how many of the <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span></span> coins will flip when you slap the book, which makes it a game with a reasonable degree of randomness — and that’s what gives it the element of chance essential to gambling.</p>\n<p>So let me throw out that opening question again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is this truly random?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though it seems random, if you think about it, the game still operates within the laws of physics. If you knew the weight of each coin, the force of the slap, and the elasticity of the book, you could theoretically calculate which coins would flip. Of course, that kind of calculation isn’t easy — so even though it’s not random in the purest sense, we just say “close enough, let’s call it random.”</p>\n<p>In other words, true randomness is surprisingly rare even in our everyday lives. We just think things are random.</p>\n<h2 id=\"randomness-in-computers\" style=\"position:relative;\">Randomness in Computers<a href=\"#randomness-in-computers\" aria-label=\"randomness in computers permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Just as we label things “random” in daily life when they have a reasonable degree of unpredictability, computers don’t generate true randomness either — they produce a convincing enough level of unpredictability and call it random. On top of that, creating something on a computer requires defining rules, and the very idea of using rules to generate rule-less randomness is a contradiction.</p>\n<p>That’s why all we can really create is pseudo-random — something that’s not truly random but close enough. And since computers are fundamentally number-crunching calculators, generating random events requires the ability to produce random numbers.</p>\n<p>So how do computers actually generate these random numbers?</p>\n<h3 id=\"mid-square-method\" style=\"position:relative;\">Mid-Square Method<a href=\"#mid-square-method\" aria-label=\"mid square method permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The Mid-Square Method is a pseudo-random number generation technique devised by John von Neumann in 1949. The idea is simple: take a number, square it, then extract a portion from the middle of the result to use as the next random number.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we want to generate 4-digit random numbers, starting with <code class=\"language-text\">1234</code>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phase</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Squared</th>\n<th>Random Number</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1234</td>\n<td>1522756</td>\n<td>1<strong>5227</strong>56</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5227</td>\n<td>27321529</td>\n<td>27<strong>3215</strong>29</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3215</td>\n<td>10336225</td>\n<td>10<strong>3362</strong>25</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You keep extracting the middle digits and squaring them to generate the next random number. It’s pretty obviously predictable, right? Well, this was developed in the 1950s when von Neumann was active, and computers of that era were painfully underpowered, so the simplest possible approach was necessary. That’s why this method is rarely used today.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linear-congruential-method\" style=\"position:relative;\">Linear Congruential Method<a href=\"#linear-congruential-method\" aria-label=\"linear congruential method permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The Linear Congruential Method is the algorithm used by C’s <code class=\"language-text\">rand</code> function.

That’s why I declared the <code class=\"language-text\">m</code> variable with <code class=\"language-text\">let</code>. Try assigning a small number to <code class=\"language-text\">m</code> in your browser console and calling <code class=\"language-text\">getRandomNumbers</code> again — you’ll notice duplicate values appearing much more frequently.</p>\n<p>The Linear Congruential Method has been widely used in computers since the early days because the computation is extremely simple and fast. However, it has a periodic cycle and correlations exist between generated numbers, meaning that if you know the last generated number and the other variables, you can predict all subsequent numbers.</p>\n<p>The problem is that those variables are defined by the ANSI C standard, so anyone can look them up. In other words, anyone with a bit of knowledge can observe the output of <code class=\"language-text\">rand</code> and predict the next random number.</p>\n<p>That’s why this algorithm is mainly used in situations where it doesn’t matter if the random numbers are predicted, or in constrained environments like embedded systems where memory is limited.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mersenne-twister\" style=\"position:relative;\">Mersenne Twister<a href=\"#mersenne-twister\" aria-label=\"mersenne twister permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The Mersenne Twister is a random number generation algorithm used in Excel, MATLAB, PHP, Python, R, C++, and many others. It was developed in 1997 by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura. The name comes from the fact that the algorithm’s period is a Mersenne prime.</p>\n<p>“Mersenne prime” might sound fancy, but it’s actually straightforward. A Mersenne number is <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">M_n = 2^{n} - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">M</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.109em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">n</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7477em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6644em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">−</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span></span> — just 2 to the power of n, minus 1. A Mersenne prime is simply a Mersenne number that happens to be prime.</p>\n<p>The most commonly used variant is “MT19937,” which has a period of <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>19937</mn></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">2^{19937} - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8974em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">19937</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">−</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span></span>. C++ also uses this algorithm. Here’s a simplified overview of how it works:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a seed to generate a vector of length 624. The seed is usually derived from hardware noise or the current date.</li>\n<li>Use this vector to produce 624 pseudo-random numbers.</li>\n<li>Apply noise to the vector and repeat step 2. This noise application is called “twisting.”</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The twisting step uses a technique called GFSR (Generalized Feedback Shift Register). There isn’t much accessible material on GFSR — most of it is academic papers — so I wasn’t able to dig into it deeply. But after some extensive Googling and poring over papers, I found that it appears to be a variation of LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register). <small>(Information was so limited that I’m not 100% certain it’s LFSR-based.)</small></p>\n<p>LFSR takes previous state values, runs them through a linear function, and uses the result to generate the next value. The function typically used is XOR, and the initial value is called the seed.</p>\n<img src=\"/ad9106cf75abf61d96aea27d0f40cef7/lfsr.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n<p>Here’s a brief explanation of LFSR: you designate a few memory addresses and push an initialized input (the seed) into the register. The bits shift one position to the right, and you get one bit popping out at the end as output. Then you access the pre-designated memory addresses, extract their values, and pass them through three XOR gates in sequence to produce the next input, which you push back into the register. Repeat.</p>\n<p>Since the Mersenne Twister uses GFSR — a slight variation of LFSR — to generate random numbers, it also requires an initial seed.</p>\n<p>For the detailed algorithm, check the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister#Algorithmic_detail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mersenne Twister - Algorithmic detail</a>. I ported the C implementation of MT19937 — which Matsumoto and Nishimura revised and improved in 2002 — to JavaScript. This code is designed for 32-bit random numbers. There’s a separate 64-bit version called MT19937-64.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code

If I had to describe sound in one word, it would be “vibration.” Basically, hearing sound happens in this order:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Some object vibrates. Let’s say the vibration frequency is about <code class=\"language-text\">440Hz</code>.</li>\n<li>The medium around that object transmits the <code class=\"language-text\">440Hz</code> vibration (usually air in normal situations).</li>\n<li>When the medium transmits the vibration, our eardrum also vibrates at <code class=\"language-text\">440Hz</code>.</li>\n<li>The cochlea converts that vibration signal into electrical signals and sends them to the auditory nerve.</li>\n<li>The brain receives and interprets the signal. <code class=\"language-text\">440Hz</code> received!</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Here, we use the unit Hertz (Hz) to express how many times the object vibrated in one second in step 1. <code class=\"language-text\">10Hz</code> means it vibrated 10 times in one second, and <code class=\"language-text\">1kHz</code> means it vibrated 1,000 times in one second.</p>\n<p>By the way, <code class=\"language-text\">440Hz</code> in the example is the note “A” in do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do. So when we listen to music, we’re actually feeling vibrations — the vibration of strings for string instruments, the vibration of lips or reeds for wind instruments, and the vibration of vocal cords for singing. Even the most emotional music can be broken down like this in an engineer’s hands.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/6e3222c117b2f5be65d4a041d5f0bf99/eea4a/s-oche.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"s oche\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/6e3222c117b2f5be65d4a041d5f0bf99/c08c5/s-oche.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/6e3222c117b2f5be65d4a041d5f0bf99/0913d/s-oche.jpg 160w,\n/static/6e3222c117b2f5be65d4a041d5f0bf99/cb69c/s-oche.jpg 320w,\n/static/6e3222c117b2f5be65d4a041d5f0bf99/c08c5/s-oche.jpg 640w,\n/static/6e3222c117b2f5be65d4a041d5f0bf99/6a068/s-oche.jpg 960w,\n/static/6e3222c117b2f5be65d4a041d5f0bf99/eea4a/s-oche.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The beautiful melodies we hear are just bundles of vibration frequencies when you break them down.</small>\n</center>\n<p>These vibrations occur in nature, so they appear in analog form.

The terms that come up here are Sample Rate and Bit Rate.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 439px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5c4ef295d012e89f63bcd069e92fb4b5/e3b18/encoder.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 36.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"encoder\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/5c4ef295d012e89f63bcd069e92fb4b5/e3b18/encoder.png\" srcset=\"/static/5c4ef295d012e89f63bcd069e92fb4b5/69538/encoder.png 160w,\n/static/5c4ef295d012e89f63bcd069e92fb4b5/72799/encoder.png 320w,\n/static/5c4ef295d012e89f63bcd069e92fb4b5/e3b18/encoder.png 439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Difficult words that make you not know what to adjust when using encoder programs</small>\n</center>\n<p>The terms look difficult, but they’re actually simple.

As explained above, sound as an analog signal is continuous, so computers cannot understand this signal as-is.

The <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> part going up is where air compresses, and the <code class=\"language-text\">-</code> part going down is where air expands again.</p>\n<p>As I’ve been explaining, sound is vibration, and what we feel is the air trembling from that vibration. So we need to feel compression > expansion > compression to sense “it vibrated!” In other words, the 20,000 vibrations we can hear means this cycle repeats 20,000 times per second.</p>\n<p>You can’t feel “this is vibration” if you only continuously feel either compression or expansion alone.</p>\n<p>So to properly measure one cycle of an audio signal, you need to measure both the top peak in the + direction and the bottom peak in the - direction — at minimum 2 measurements are required. So to properly measure <code class=\"language-text\">20kHz</code>, the highest sound humans can hear at 20,000 vibrations per second, the computer must measure at least <code class=\"language-text\">20,000 * 2 = 40,000</code> times per second.</p>\n<p>This is exactly why CDs have a sample rate of <code class=\"language-text\">44.1kHz</code>. This is called the Nyquist Theorem. In short, the Nyquist theorem can be summarized as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have an audio frequency you want to measure? If you want to capture the audio signal properly, you need to measure at least twice as fast as that frequency.</p>\n<p>So prepare a sample rate at least double the audio frequency you want to measure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But here another question arises. According to that theory, since the human audible frequency is <code class=\"language-text\">20,000Hz</code>, we should be able to record all sounds humans can hear with just 40,000 measurements. So why measure 44,100 or 48,000 times?</p>\n<p>Because nature doesn’t only have humans — there are friends like these too:</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f9e7d3854217d95b93299ec30c34597c/eea4a/dolphin.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"dolphin\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/f9e7d3854217d95b93299ec30c34597c/c08c5/dolphin.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/f9e7d3854217d95b93299ec30c34597c/0913d/dolphin.jpg 160w,\n/static/f9e7d3854217d95b93299ec30c34597c/cb69c/dolphin.jpg 320w,\n/static/f9e7d3854217d95b93299ec30c34597c/c08c5/dolphin.jpg 640w,\n/static/f9e7d3854217d95b93299ec30c34597c/6a068/dolphin.jpg 960w,\n/static/f9e7d3854217d95b93299ec30c34597c/eea4a/dolphin.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Hello.

So looking at the points the computer plotted, you can see they’re plotted at awkward places, not at the signal’s peaks. This is the trap that the Nyquist theorem has. And if you connect those awkwardly plotted points (the blue line), you can see it becomes a low frequency. What happens then?</p>\n<p>It becomes very audible to our ears. A truly spine-chilling moment! Nothing was audible when recording, but when listening to the recording, there’s a strange sound recorded. So this phenomenon is called “Ghost Frequency.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then just crank up the sample rate! Wouldn’t properly recording high sounds solve the problem?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But since this digital audio technology first started being used in the 1970s, hardware capacity couldn’t keep up with arbitrarily raising sample rates.</p>\n<p>So the method used to solve this problem was LPF (Low Pass Filter). This filter should be very familiar to those who’ve studied electronics — it literally only passes low frequencies through. If you use an LPF when recording audio to cut off all sounds higher than the human audible frequency and only let sounds in the human audible range pass through, the ghost frequency problem I just mentioned won’t occur.</p>\n<p>But analog signals don’t get cut cleanly like cutting radishes.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/bcb489965646eb5446167bbddb504813/c1b63/cut-off.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 70.625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"cut off\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/bcb489965646eb5446167bbddb504813/6af66/cut-off.png\" srcset=\"/static/bcb489965646eb5446167bbddb504813/69538/cut-off.png 160w,\n/static/bcb489965646eb5446167bbddb504813/72799/cut-off.png 320w,\n/static/bcb489965646eb5446167bbddb504813/6af66/cut-off.png 640w,\n/static/bcb489965646eb5446167bbddb504813/d9199/cut-off.png 960w,\n/static/bcb489965646eb5446167bbddb504813/c1b63/cut-off.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>Even with an LPF, the cut portion slopes down diagonally, leaving some less-than-ideal parts.

First, let’s extract audio signals one by one from <code class=\"language-text\">AudioBuffer</code>.</p>\n<p>Let’s first look at the array containing audio signals. When I briefly looked at the <code class=\"language-text\">AudioBuffer</code> data earlier, there was a property called <code class=\"language-text\">numberOfChannels</code> with value <code class=\"language-text\">2</code> for <code class=\"language-text\">stereo</code> channels.

All the values I see now are <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>, but that’s because music usually doesn’t start with a BANG! — the elements at later indices have proper values. But we can’t use these values as-is; we need to refine them a bit.</p>\n<p>First, let’s think about what those elements in the array actually are. Using the array length <code class=\"language-text\">12225071</code>, we can figure out what this friend is. When we looked at this song’s playback duration through <code class=\"language-text\">AudioBuffer</code> earlier, it was about 277 seconds. Multiplying this song’s sample rate by playback duration gives <code class=\"language-text\">12225071</code>. In other words, those elements are the peaks — the voltages the computer measured according to the sample rate.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f62ba441843fe9172b18fc5498bd765d/2c288/sampling.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 48.12500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAYAAAC0VX7mAAAACXBIWXMAABcRAAAXEQHKJvM/AAAB2ElEQVR42mNgYGAQAGI+BghgZMAJ/sPkGP8zMIgBMSeQzQPVyw/ELHClbc6xwruN0/gZ8IDF0bl8S7yy5P8DDa53jRHzjWgVBwoLATGIFgZiJrDCK6te8qxwz3Bf5ZzmkV+/XwCbS0NX/eecG1prv8csyLEreaoeSMy+fj8L1BBmKA3Rszx1qtVNMTmlm3K6Sv1x3XZgz0El6xnqwbZOi+8x3msdpg8UF17oV+GyMKBCGFkdCrjokmIBlBAF4U0uaTa96dOlIYohYVafu5ivP67fDigvAcTiR0xC1SfGT7RAUsPEoOLBnjbzDCvYQGcpTUNtBgZ9QwYGPQdxVXN/26hwJyDbnJXVGKhL19/MP8BP3thRhYFBy4SV1dAASIcb+4W6K+ramgPVGTMwGPmLK/rqazu6AY1TgDmUJRQSFgxzfEost5kH6wFdI/KQn19palijI0P9fyak8GLIrlgnvMopwfUz0MUgl88MbbTP968XgHu7HqgYFh6LYrq55wZVu4C8t84p2awrbaYyzHv/IUkGHK4TY9sN9xp46x/Vc9UBWmqKHqZMyOHWnDlVdotthPfMwFrT/7jS5v//TEt9si3Xu6Q5A9ms6NKM6OxtHrl824CBzUAiAADz6odDaFdLSQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"sampling\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/f62ba441843fe9172b18fc5498bd765d/6af66/sampling.png\" srcset=\"/static/f62ba441843fe9172b18fc5498bd765d/69538/sampling.png 160w,\n/static/f62ba441843fe9172b18fc5498bd765d/72799/sampling.png 320w,\n/static/f62ba441843fe9172b18fc5498bd765d/6af66/sampling.png 640w,\n/static/f62ba441843fe9172b18fc5498bd765d/2c288/sampling.png 684w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Each of those peaks is stored as an element in the Float32Array.</small>\n</center>\n<p>Now that we know those elements are peaks, let’s refine these friends a bit. Why refine?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is rendering all 12,225,071 peaks really efficient visualization…?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A reasonable suspicion. Whether ten million or five million peaks are plotted, we’re going to view it on a small monitor anyway, so expressing every single one doesn’t really have much meaning.</p>\n<p>So I’ll compress the peaks appropriately. Instead of collecting all peaks, I’ll create samples of appropriate length and collect only the maximum and minimum values within each sample.</p>\n<p>As explained above, according to the Nyquist theorem, we only need one maximum and one minimum to express one cycle, so there’s no problem.</p>\n<p>If my application had a waveform zoom feature, I’d need to dynamically select peaks according to how many are needed for rendering when zoom in/out events occur. But this application isn’t that sophisticated, so logic that refines only a fixed number of peaks is sufficient.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset:

But data, by itself, is not information.</p>\n<p>Data is simply a value obtained by observing the real world. It’s just a value — nothing more, nothing less.</p>\n<p>Information, on the other hand, is what you get when you process data in some way to create something meaningful. The process of turning data into information is what we call data mining.</p>\n<p>This sounds like something out of a textbook, so let me put it in simpler terms. Say the forecast tells you tomorrow’s average temperature will be 28°C (82°F). The fact that it’ll be 28°C is data — a raw observed value. Whether it came from a supercomputer or AlphaGo, it’s still just an observed number at this point.</p>\n<p>Now, hand this data to someone who plans to stay home all day. Does it matter to them? Unless they don’t have air conditioning, probably not. It’s essentially a meaningless value.</p>\n<p>Why would you care how hot it is outside if you’re not going anywhere?

You’ve been feeding companies high-quality data without even realizing it. It reminds me of Big Brother from George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, governments don’t just sit idly by. In many countries, regulations like the GDPR in Europe or various data privacy laws require companies to anonymize personal data — stripping out individually identifiable information and keeping only the data they actually need.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key principles generally include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>(Preliminary review)</strong> Determine whether the data constitutes personal information; if clearly not, it can be used freely.</li>\n<li><strong>(De-identification)</strong> Remove or replace elements that could identify individuals in datasets.</li>\n<li><strong>(Adequacy assessment)</strong> Evaluate whether the data could be easily combined with other information to re-identify individuals.</li>\n<li><strong>(Post-management)</strong> Monitor for re-identification risks and take necessary safeguards during data use.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, these regulations can be complicated, and enforcement varies — so in practice, many companies likely continue business as usual. Still, any legitimate company should have a privacy policy that explains what personal data they collect, why, and how they use it. It’s worth reading, even if it’s tedious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"now-for-the-data-driven-decision-making\" style=\"position:relative;\">Now for the Data-Driven Decision Making!<a href=\"#now-for-the-data-driven-decision-making\" aria-label=\"now for the data driven decision making permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Data-driven decision making is essentially about analyzing the collected data to draw plausible conclusions.</p>\n<p>It’s naturally less risky than making decisions based on pure gut feeling, since you’re at least working with observed values.

As I mentioned, basing decisions on analyzed observational data is inherently less risky than relying on intuition alone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"easier-to-persuade-others\" style=\"position:relative;\">Easier to Persuade Others<a href=\"#easier-to-persuade-others\" aria-label=\"easier to persuade others permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The second advantage is that it’s much easier to convince people. I think there’s a psychological element at play here. A presentation with polished graphs, tables, and numbers just feels more credible than words alone. This is probably more relevant for roles like designers — who rely heavily on intuition — than for developers who are already comfortable with logic and numbers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a. From a UX perspective, placing this button here would make it easier for users to discover!</p>\n<p>b. Our user testing showed that 78% of users only interacted within the top 20% of the page before leaving. Therefore…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It comes down to the difference between these two approaches.

The river level rises in summer because roughly 70% of annual rainfall is concentrated in the summer months — not simply because it’s summer.</p>\n<p>In business, most variable relationships are correlations, so you should always consider whether there are hidden variables and maintain a healthy skepticism about whether the results are truly reliable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"examples-of-bad-decisions\" style=\"position:relative;\">Examples of Bad Decisions<a href=\"#examples-of-bad-decisions\" aria-label=\"examples of bad decisions permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>To illustrate what happens when you blindly trust data, here are two classic examples commonly used to demonstrate the dangers of data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A researcher was examining the seasonal trends in ice cream sales throughout the year. They also plotted the seasonal trends in drowning deaths alongside it and ran a correlation analysis between the two datasets.</p>\n<p>The results were striking.</p>\n<p>There was an unmistakably clear correlation. During periods when ice cream sales increased, drowning deaths also increased. When ice cream sales decreased, drowning deaths decreased as well.</p>\n<p>Shuddering at the implications, the researcher drew the following conclusion:</p>\n<p><strong>“Ice cream is the cause of drowning deaths.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this example, the researcher is essentially saying “the more ice cream is sold, the more people drown.” It sounds absurd, but ice cream sales and drowning deaths do in fact correlate.</p>\n<p>The hidden variable here is temperature. When summer arrives and it gets hot, ice cream sales go up. At the same time, more people go to beaches and rivers for vacation, so accidental drowning deaths also increase.</p>\n<p>If you failed to identify temperature as the hidden variable, you might end up with a decision like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To reduce drowning deaths, we ban ice cream sales.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now for the second example.

Qualitative data, on the other hand, requires more deliberate methods like user testing and surveys.</p>\n<p>Moreover, qualitative data often comes in the form of natural language rather than numbers, making it harder to analyze.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I’ve often seen qualitative data get deprioritized — but that’s not a good practice. Quantitative data explains what happened; qualitative data explains why.</p>\n<p>For example, the difference looks like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After users engaged with our search system, the conversion rate increased by 30%. (Quantitative data)</p>\n<p>Survey results showed that users felt they could find products that better matched their needs by searching on their own. (Qualitative data)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You could technically convert that qualitative example into quantitative data — by using multiple-choice questions instead of open-ended ones. But then you can only capture the reasons you’ve already thought of, which is why most surveys include an “Other (please specify)” option. And whatever people write in that box? That’s qualitative data.</p>\n<p>Just think about it: the “Other” field will contain natural language that people took the time to write out individually, and classifying and analyzing all of that requires either artificial intelligence or a lot of human effort.</p>\n<p>That’s why most companies lean toward easier-to-handle quantitative data and use qualitative data as supplementary. But companies that genuinely want to hear what their customers want invest the resources to continuously collect qualitative data through surveys and user testing, even when it’s costly.</p>\n<p>At my workplace, we don’t have the resources to do it frequently, but for major feature launches, our UI/UX designers invite users who match selected personas to the office for user testing sessions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I think data-driven decision making is a double-edged sword. Used well, it delivers the advantages I described — lower risk, clear outcome measurement, and the ability to abstract complex problems. Used poorly, you end up blindly trusting numbers without realizing something has gone wrong, making bad decision after bad decision.</p>\n<p>The “clear expectations and outcomes” advantage can also become a disadvantage. As I’ve repeatedly emphasized, data is ultimately just raw values, and the conclusions drawn from it inevitably involve human subjectivity. This means you can predetermine the result you want and massage the data to fit — producing conclusions that look perfectly plausible.</p>\n<p>These tendencies can lead to decisions that optimize for metrics the company considers important rather than actually serving customers. Or worse, someone might manipulate variables until they get the result they want — even if customers are dissatisfied and conversion rates are dropping — all to earn recognition from higher-ups. It becomes a political tool rather than an analytical one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These behaviors aren’t data-driven decision making — they’re number games dressed up as data-driven decision making.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s why, whenever you make data-driven decisions, you must constantly ask yourself: Did I reach an objective and fair conclusion? Is this data truly uncontaminated and capable of yielding meaningful results? If the results came out as I hoped, why did they turn out this way? Maintaining this critical mindset is essential.</p>\n<p>That wraps up this post on whether data-driven decision making is really as flawless as it seems.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190704-danger-of-data-driven-en","path":"/2019/07/04/danger-of-data-driven/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is Data-Driven Decision Making Really Flawless?","subTitle":"The traps hidden behind numbers, and how not to be fooled by data","date":"Jul 04, 2019","categories":["Soft Skills","Essay"],"tags":["Data Driven","Data Driven Decision","Critical Thinking","Data Analysis"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/3a812/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/3a812/thumbnail.jpg 320w,\n/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/4b287/thumbnail.jpg 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/fc5c5/thumbnail.webp 320w,\n/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/e9225/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/2d839/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/2d839/thumbnail.jpg 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/62d8b411322961c62d1d801e6d053f62/b384d/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c89b338e-9c45-587b-bde2-7796b2358635","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#why-use-agile\">Why Use Agile?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#the-agile-manifesto\">The Agile Manifesto</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#the-twelve-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto\">The Twelve Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#the-core-elements-of-agile\">The Core Elements of Agile</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#user-story\">User Story</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#product-backlog\">Product Backlog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#estimation\">Estimation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#retrospective\">Retrospective</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#so-is-agile-good\">So Is Agile Good?</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#this-isnt-agile\">“This Isn’t Agile!”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#dont-get-too-hung-up-on-agile\">Don’t Get Too Hung Up on Agile</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"In this post, I want to talk about the agile process — one of the many software development methodologies out there.

Many organizations have already adopted agile, and the company I work at is no exception.</p>\n<p>A lot of teams focus on the surface-level rituals: assigning story points to issues, running 1-2 week sprints, holding daily scrum meetings. My workplace was doing all of that too, but everyone kept asking “what does it actually mean to work in an agile way?” without ever getting a proper answer.</p>\n<p>We started without understanding the essence of agile — just “I tried this a few times and it worked great!” or “another company does this and they improved!” Naturally, things didn’t go smoothly. Estimations were consistently off, sprints kept falling apart, and team morale suffered. So my company, <a href=\"https://soomgo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soomgo</a>, invested a significant amount of money to bring in an agile coach for about a month of training.</p>\n<p>In this post, I’d like to share what I learned from that experience, along with what I noticed after trying various approaches in practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-use-agile\" style=\"position:relative;\">Why Use Agile?<a href=\"#why-use-agile\" aria-label=\"why use agile permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Since so many organizations already use agile, I’ll assume most of you have a general idea of what it is.</p>\n<p>Agile means “nimble” — it’s a development methodology born from the intent to find a balance between having no plan at all and having an overly rigid plan.</p>\n<p>The traditional approach is best represented by the waterfall model.

In this post, I’ll focus on the ones I consider most important: User Story, Backlog, Estimation, and Retrospective. Let’s take a quick look at each.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-story\" style=\"position:relative;\">User Story<a href=\"#user-story\" aria-label=\"user story permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Agile is built around user stories. Stories are crucial, and they must be thoroughly <strong>user-centric</strong>. When we typically create stories or issues, they tend to look something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>SD-1234 Revamp the request form page</li>\n<li>SD-1235 Convert the webview-based profile page to native</li>\n<li>SD-1236 Design DB schema and create API endpoints for social login</li>\n<li>SD-1237 Add multi-photo sending feature to user chat</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I received agile coaching, this was the very first thing the coach pointed out. The coach recommended that stories include three elements wherever possible: <strong>Who</strong>, <strong>What</strong>, and <strong>Why</strong>.</p>\n<p>Stories written this way explain, through the title alone, why the team needs to address them. So the stories above should be rewritten like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>SD-1234 A <strong>customer</strong> can see all the information they need at a glance to easily submit a request.</li>\n<li>SD-1235 A <strong>customer</strong> can use the profile page as a native view instead of a webview for a more natural UX.</li>\n<li>SD-1236 A <strong>client developer</strong> can use the relevant API endpoints to build the social login feature.</li>\n<li>SD-1237 A <strong>customer</strong> can use a multi-select feature to easily send multiple photos in a chat.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>User stories written this way can be understood by any team member — even someone completely unrelated to the story — without additional explanation.</p>\n<p>And the user (Who) doesn’t always have to be the customer. In <code class=\"language-text\">SD-1236</code>, the user is the client developer. In cases like this, you still fill in all the information: the client developer (Who) can use the relevant API endpoints (What) to build the social login feature (Why). Team members are both producers and each other’s internal customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"product-backlog\" style=\"position:relative;\">Product Backlog<a href=\"#product-backlog\" aria-label=\"product backlog permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The product backlog consists of multiple user stories that need to be addressed. These stories are sorted by priority as defined by the PO (Product Owner), and prioritization authority rests solely with the PO. A fundamental prerequisite of agile is that team members trust the PO’s decisions.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean blindly following orders — you can freely discuss and voice opinions, but the final call is the PO’s.</p>\n<p>The backlog will keep accumulating stories if left unattended, so the PO needs to periodically review and prune it — deciding which stories are still relevant and which aren’t. Without this maintenance, it takes increasingly longer to sort through and evaluate the backlog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"estimation\" style=\"position:relative;\">Estimation<a href=\"#estimation\" aria-label=\"estimation permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Estimation is the process where team members who will actually work on the stories assess how large each story is by assigning story points.</p>\n<p>A common approach is to use absolute values — if an issue takes 1 hour, it gets 1 story point. My team initially did this too. We decided that 4 hours was a realistic amount of focused work per day, so a task taking about a day was estimated at 4 points.</p>\n<p>The problem was that these estimates were almost always wrong. Unless you’re some kind of savant who can predict exactly when your work will be done, unexpected bugs, surprise meetings, or sick days throw everything off. It happened more often than you’d think, and each time, the sprint would blow up.</p>\n<p>So we switched to <strong>relative</strong> story points. Here’s how it works. You pick a past story as a reference point and have the team estimate it based on their memory of that experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SD-1234 A customer can see all the information they need at a glance to easily submit a request.</strong></p>\n<p>Alice: <em>This one wasn’t that much work, I think. I’d say 3.</em></p>\n<p>Bob: <em>I was doing overtime every day designing this. I’d say 5.</em></p>\n<p>Charlie: <em>I have a crush on Bob, so I’ll say 5 too.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once the team converges on a rough consensus — “redesigning the request form page was about a 5” — you use that as a baseline to relatively measure other stories. You can use T-shirt sizes like <code class=\"language-text\">XS, SM, M, L, XL</code>, or natural numbers like <code class=\"language-text\">1, 2, 3, 4</code>. Since you’re measuring relative size, any abstract scale works.</p>\n<p>For reference, my team uses the Fibonacci sequence: <code class=\"language-text\">1, 2, 3, 5, 8...</code></p>\n<p>Measuring relative size might feel strange at first, but from my experience, it’s more accurate than estimating in hours. The caveat is that you first need to know roughly how many story points your team can handle in a sprint.</p>\n<p>This is figured out by simply running a few sprints. If you completed <code class=\"language-text\">40</code> points in the first sprint and <code class=\"language-text\">20</code> in the second, load about <code class=\"language-text\">30</code> points into the next sprint.</p>\n<p>Even though the second sprint’s completion rate dropped 50% compared to the first, don’t worry!</p>\n<p>Unfinished issues from the second sprint carry over to the third, so the third sprint’s completion rate will be higher than expected. Average it out over a few sprints, and you’ll get a reliable baseline for your team’s velocity.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 493px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/78ff8/dash.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 136.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"dash\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/78ff8/dash.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/0913d/dash.jpg 160w,\n/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/cb69c/dash.jpg 320w,\n/static/ebd2e73b77c8a5a1b46423a098f0839e/78ff8/dash.jpg 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>A bad sprint is likely followed by an overachieving one!</small>\n</center>\n<p>And here’s the important part: the sprint deadline is not a hard deadline.

One method is to draw a timeline, have team members write warm moments and cold moments on sticky notes, place them on the timeline, and vote on topics to discuss. Another is to simply have everyone bring a topic and discuss freely.</p>\n<p>Through the retrospective, the team decides on action items for the next sprint and assigns an owner to each one.

You don’t have to follow the manifesto or the principles to the letter. If your team comes up with some creative approach that works for them, that’s perfectly fine.

Just get the work done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dont-get-too-hung-up-on-agile\" style=\"position:relative;\">Don’t Get Too Hung Up on Agile<a href=\"#dont-get-too-hung-up-on-agile\" aria-label=\"dont get too hung up on agile permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>When I first heard the Agile Manifesto, I’ll be honest — it reminded me of communism.</p>\n<p>When Marx first proposed Marxism and wrote <em>Das Kapital</em>, the prevailing sentiment among workers was that communism was the perfect system, that it would keep evolving while capitalism would eventually collapse on its own. But communism in practice hit the wall of reality, mutating into Stalinism, Maoism, and other variants that mostly ended in dictatorship.</p>\n<p>What started as “let’s all prosper together” became “let’s all be poor together” once it met the real world.</p>\n<p>Similarly, agile in practice doesn’t always run as smoothly as the theory suggests. The situation I described above is one of many awkward scenarios. What do you do when an issue can’t be broken down and won’t fit within a single sprint?</p>\n<p>The Agile Manifesto says all the right things, but obsessing over it can turn your organization into one that creates work for the sake of work.</p>\n<p>Consider the capitalism we enjoy today. If it had stayed as Adam Smith originally envisioned — “leave the market alone and it’ll sort itself out” — it probably would have collapsed. But by incorporating good ideas from socialism through policies like the New Deal — nationalization programs, welfare policies — capitalism evolved and survived. Nothing is absolutely perfect.</p>\n<p>Likewise, whether it’s agile, waterfall, kanban, or whatever else — I think all that matters is working efficiently. So I took the Agile Manifesto in one ear and let it out the other. Mix and match whatever looks good, and if it works for your team, that’s all that counts. The manifesto says such obvious things that it didn’t feel worth memorizing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>What I took away from the agile coaching was the ironic realization that “there’s no right answer in agile” — and simultaneously, “wait, so does that mean as long as you can ship products nimbly, the manifesto and everything else doesn’t actually matter?”</p>\n<p>I still believe that agile is simply about delivering products to customers nimbly — whether your sprints are one week or two, however you do estimation, whatever your method. It doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>That said, if your team is looking to adopt agile, I think it’s worth doing it properly, which is why I’m sharing what I learned from our coaching experience. Having the team come together, try different approaches, reflect on what worked through retrospectives, and discuss how to improve — that’s an experience that’s genuinely hard to come by. It’s actually really fun, I promise.</p>\n<p>Agile, done right, requires a surprising amount of study. There’s a lot to learn, and you need the ability to adapt and evaluate these concepts for your specific team. But from what I’ve experienced firsthand and heard from developers at other organizations, many teams that claim to practice agile are simply running sprints, holding daily scrum meetings, and using JIRA — and calling that agile.</p>\n<p>Without knowing how many story points your team can realistically handle per sprint, or checking whether your external and internal customers are actually satisfied — agile without this kind of continuous inspection is nothing more than repeating 1-2 week deadlines. I’ve been there, and trust me, it’s miserable. The constant pressure of deadlines every single week… ugh.</p>\n<p>I hope that as you develop an interest in agile, you’ll also bring a passion for collaboration — and that you can have fun while working with your team.</p>\n<p>That wraps up this post on what agile even is.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190702-what-is-agile-en","path":"/2019/07/02/what-is-agile/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Even Is Agile, Anyway?","subTitle":"For teams that adopted agile but can't seem to make it work","date":"Jul 02, 2019","categories":["Soft Skills"],"tags":["Agile","Agile Process","Software Development Methodology","Team Management"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/3a812/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/3a812/thumbnail.jpg 320w,\n/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/4b287/thumbnail.jpg 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/fc5c5/thumbnail.webp 320w,\n/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/e9225/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/2d839/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/2d839/thumbnail.jpg 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ddbff2c3ca65fe24699da104fe514fa7/b384d/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"903e28d3-c3a1-5cde-90da-2d3a97bb77cf","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#what-is-the-v8-engine\">What Is the V8 Engine?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#how-the-v8-engine-works\">How the V8 Engine Works</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#parsing-understanding-what-the-code-means\">Parsing: Understanding What the Code Means</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#generating-bytecode-with-ignition\">Generating Bytecode with Ignition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#cooling-down-hot-code-with-turbofan\">Cooling Down Hot Code with TurboFan</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#closing-thoughts\">Closing Thoughts</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"In this post, I want to explore how Google’s V8 engine interprets and executes JavaScript.

It’s currently used in Google Chrome and Node.js, and implements the ECMAScript and WebAssembly standards.</p>\n<p>As of June 28, 2019, if you check the <a href=\"https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kangax Table</a>, you can see that CH (Chromium) and Node — both powered by V8 — have implemented nearly all ES2016+ features, while Microsoft’s Chakra and Mozilla’s SpiderMonkey still have noticeable gaps marked in red.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To improve compatibility with other platforms and reduce mutual risk, Microsoft Edge will now use the V8 engine as part of this change.

The parser analyzes the source code and transforms it into an <code class=\"language-text\">AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)</code>.</p>\n<p>Next, this AST is passed to <code class=\"language-text\">Ignition</code>, which is an interpreter that converts JavaScript into bytecode. By converting the original source into bytecode — a form much easier for the computer to interpret — V8 avoids the overhead of re-parsing the original code, reduces the amount of code, and saves memory during execution.</p>\n<p>The bytecode is then executed, making our source code actually run. Among the executed code, frequently used portions are sent to <code class=\"language-text\">TurboFan</code>, where they’re recompiled into <code class=\"language-text\">Optimized Machine Code</code>. If that code later becomes less frequently used, it gets deoptimized.</p>\n<p>An interesting detail is that many of V8’s components are named after real engine parts. The V8 engine is actually a type of engine commonly found in high-performance cars — named because eight pistons are arranged in a V shape, driving a single crankshaft.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Ignition</code> refers to the igniter used to start an engine. Your source code is revving up and running. And when it gets called too many times and your code starts running hot, <code class=\"language-text\">TurboFan</code> optimizes it — cooling things down so it doesn’t overheat.</p>\n<p>If you’ve read other V8 analysis posts, you may have also seen components called <code class=\"language-text\">Full-codegen</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Crankshaft</code>. The name <code class=\"language-text\">Crankshaft</code> also comes from real engines — it’s the core component connected to the pistons that converts their reciprocating motion into rotational motion. But as of June 19, 2019, these components can no longer be found in V8.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Starting with V8 v5.9, Ignition and TurboFan are used across the board for JavaScript execution. Additionally, starting with V8 v5.9, Full-codegen and Crankshaft — technologies that have served V8 well — are no longer used in V8, as they were unable to keep up with new JavaScript features and the optimizations those features demand. We plan to remove them entirely soon, which means V8 will have a much simpler and more maintainable architecture going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>V8 team</strong> <em><a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/launching-ignition-and-turbofan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Launching Ignition and TurboFan</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 509px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/843ec14e0e37c1082ef853b3b1bb2f81/05852/bye.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.37499999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"bye\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/843ec14e0e37c1082ef853b3b1bb2f81/05852/bye.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/843ec14e0e37c1082ef853b3b1bb2f81/0913d/bye.jpg 160w,\n/static/843ec14e0e37c1082ef853b3b1bb2f81/cb69c/bye.jpg 320w,\n/static/843ec14e0e37c1082ef853b3b1bb2f81/05852/bye.jpg 509w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Yep.

The AST is a data structure widely used in compilers — think of it as restructuring the source code we write into a form that’s easy for the computer to understand.</p>\n<p>For example, if we were to parse JavaScript with JavaScript, it would look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">hello</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Hello,'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> name<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// The code above can be roughly structured like this:</span>\n\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'FunctionDeclaration'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'hello'</span>\n  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">arguments</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Variable'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'name'</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// ...</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Laid out like this, it’s simpler than you might expect.

That’s why the parser’s internals are surprisingly large. V8’s <code class=\"language-text\">parser.cc</code> file alone exceeds 3,000 lines.</p>\n<p>In any case, just remember that parsing is the process of converting code into an AST — a form that’s easy for the computer to analyze.

Before explaining what a hash function is or what “hash” even means, let’s first understand where the concept of hash tables originated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"direct-address-table\" style=\"position:relative;\">Direct Address Table<a href=\"#direct-address-table\" aria-label=\"direct address table permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The idea behind hash tables evolved from a data structure called the Direct Address Table.

Sure, it’s a crude hash function, but it does perform its core job of hashing just fine.</p>\n<p>My crude hash function simply divides the input by <code class=\"language-text\">10</code> and returns the remainder. Since only the ones digit is returned regardless of input, the output is guaranteed to be between <code class=\"language-text\">0-9</code>.</p>\n<p>One characteristic of hash functions is that looking at the hash alone makes it hard to guess what the input was. You can’t determine the original number just by looking at the ones digit. This is why hash functions are widely used in cryptography.</p>\n<p>But what’s important for us isn’t cryptography — it’s this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter what value goes into the hash function, it will always return a value between <strong>0-9</strong>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The weakness of direct address tables was that even if just one value like <code class=\"language-text\">10000</code> came in, you’d need to create a table of size <code class=\"language-text\">10000</code> to store it at index <code class=\"language-text\">10000</code>, wasting <code class=\"language-text\">9999</code> spaces.</p>\n<p>But with my hash function, <code class=\"language-text\">100</code> returns <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">10001</code> returns <code class=\"language-text\">1</code>, and even <code class=\"language-text\">8982174981274</code> returns <code class=\"language-text\">4</code>.</p>\n<p>This means we can set a fixed table size and store data only within that space. Let me write a simple hash table using this property of hash functions. I’ll set the hash table size to <code class=\"language-text\">5</code> and write a hash function that ensures any value can be stored in this table.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> myTableSize <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> myHashTable <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myTableSize<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">hashFunction</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// Divide the input by table size and return the remainder</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> key <span class=\"token operator\">%</span> myTableSize<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\nmyHashTable<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token function\">hashFunction</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1991</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1991</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nmyHashTable<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token function\">hashFunction</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1234</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1234</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nmyHashTable<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token function\">hashFunction</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">5678</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5678</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myHashTable<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// [empty, 1991, empty, 5678, 1234]</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal;

In this case, collisions occur not only when the hash is <code class=\"language-text\">1</code>, but also when it’s <code class=\"language-text\">2</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">3</code>.</p>\n<p>This creates a truly vicious cycle. As collisions continue, data gets stored consecutively, eventually forming a massive cluster of data. Then any hash value that falls within the indices occupied by that cluster will collide, and the colliding value gets stored behind the cluster, making it even larger.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Collision!</strong> -> Store colliding value behind the cluster -> Increased collision probability -> <strong>Collision!</strong> -> Store again, cluster grows -> Increased collision probability -> <strong>Collision</strong>…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This painful infinite loop occurs.

Instead of storing a single value in each hash table bucket, it uses a linked list or tree.\nSince the concept is the same whether you use a tree or linked list, I’ll explain using a linked list.</p>\n<p>Let’s bring back the example we’ve been using. When the table size is <code class=\"language-text\">5</code> and we need to store <code class=\"language-text\">1991</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">6</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">13</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">21</code> — all of which hash to <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> — using separate chaining looks like this:</p>\n<br />\n<ul class=\"hash-table-dummy\">\n  <li><dt>0</dt><dd></dd></li>\n  <li><dt>1</dt><dd>[21, 13, 6, 1991]</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>2</dt><dd></dd></li>\n  <li><dt>3</dt><dd></dd></li>\n  <li><dt>4</dt><dd></dd></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>Simple. But look closely — the order is <code class=\"language-text\">[21, 13, 6, 1991]</code>, not <code class=\"language-text\">[1991, 6, 13, 21]</code>. It’s reversed.</p>\n<p>This is a technique to reduce insertion time even slightly. To understand why reversing the data reduces insertion time, let’s look at the process of inserting new data when the linked list stored at index <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> of our table is in the order <code class=\"language-text\">[1991, 6, 13, 21]</code>.</p>\n<br />\n<ul class=\"hash-table-dummy\">\n  <li><dt>1</dt><dd>{ value: 1991, next: 2 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>2</dt><dd>{ value: 6, next: 3 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>3</dt><dd>{ value: 13, next: 4 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>4</dt><dd>{ value: 21, next: null }</dd></li>\n</ul>\n<center><small>Looks similar to a hash table, but this time it's a linked list</small></center>\n<br />\n<p>Let’s say we want to add <code class=\"language-text\">11</code>. Memory address <code class=\"language-text\">99</code> happens to be free, so we store <code class=\"language-text\">{ value: 11, next: null }</code> there. Then, to attach this new node to the list, we need to traverse to the last node in the list stored at memory <code class=\"language-text\">4</code>.</p>\n<p>Then we change the value at memory <code class=\"language-text\">4</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">{ value: 21, next: 99 }</code> and we’re done.</p>\n<br />\n<ul class=\"hash-table-dummy\">\n  <li><dt>1</dt><dd>{ value: 1991, next: 2 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>2</dt><dd>{ value: 6, next: 3 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>3</dt><dd>{ value: 13, next: 4 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>4</dt><dd>{ value: 21, next: 99 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>99</dt><dd>{ value: 11, next: null }</dd></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>The problem is the process of finding the node at memory <code class=\"language-text\">4</code> to attach the new node to the list. Due to linked list characteristics, checking data at memory <code class=\"language-text\">4</code> requires sequentially traversing from the head through each next node.</p>\n<p>This means to insert data, we must first find memory <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> (the list head), check the next memory address, move to <code class=\"language-text\">2</code>, check the next address again, and so on.</p>\n<p>This is manageable when the linked list is small, but as the list grows, execution time increases proportionally — definitely not a good approach. But reversing the order makes data insertion much easier.</p>\n<br />\n<ul class=\"hash-table-dummy\">\n  <li><dt>99</dt><dd>{ value: 11, next: 1 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>1</dt><dd>{ value: 1991, next: 2 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>2</dt><dd>{ value: 6, next: 3 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>3</dt><dd>{ value: 13, next: 4 }</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>4</dt><dd>{ value: 21, next: null }</dd></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>Since we’re adding the node at the front, we don’t need to traverse other nodes — just push it into memory and store <code class=\"language-text\">{ value: 11, next: 1 }</code>. That’s why when storing in hash tables, attaching data to the head of the list rather than the tail is commonly preferred.</p>\n<p>However, using separate chaining makes the hash function’s role extremely important. If an uneven hash causes data to cluster at a specific index, other buckets will be empty while one bucket’s list keeps growing longer.</p>\n<br />\n<ul class=\"hash-table-dummy\">\n  <li><dt>0</dt><dd></dd></li>\n  <li><dt>1</dt><dd>[21, 13, 6, 1991, 7, 11, 25, ...]</dd></li>\n  <li><dt>2</dt><dd></dd></li>\n  <li><dt>3</dt><dd></dd></li>\n  <li><dt>4</dt><dd></dd></li>\n</ul>\n<center><small>This is an extreme example, but... it's no different from just using a linked list</small></center>\n<br />\n<p>If the value I’m looking for is at the very end of the list, I’d have to traverse the linked list from start to finish, giving us <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span></span> time complexity.

While they’re all treated identically when declaring variables — that is, when V8 creates variable objects — they’re handled differently during the initialization phase, when memory space is allocated for the variable.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cpp\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp\"><span class=\"token keyword\">static</span> InitializationFlag <span class=\"token function\">DefaultInitializationFlag</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>VariableMode mode<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">DCHECK</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">IsDeclaredVariableMode</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>mode<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> mode <span class=\"token operator\">==</span> VariableMode<span class=\"token double-colon punctuation\">::</span>kVar <span class=\"token operator\">?</span> kCreatedInitialized\n                                    <span class=\"token operator\">:</span> kNeedsInitialization<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Looking at the subsequent logic, there’s a function called <code class=\"language-text\">DefaultInitializationFlag</code> that returns a <code class=\"language-text\">VariableKind</code> type used internally by V8.

Our team composition at the time was roughly like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Skill Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Frontend (me)</td>\n<td>All I knew was C and Java from school. Last time I touched JavaScript was in 4th grade.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend</td>\n<td>Had a web design certification. The only one with any web experience on this team. Took the backend role but had never touched a server.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend 2</td>\n<td>Electrical engineering major. Also had zero knowledge of databases or web. Too busy to show up often.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UI/UX Designer</td>\n<td>In the military. Hadn’t even been discharged yet. Would work occasionally while on leave.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Planner</td>\n<td>Korean-Canadian. Music major. Zero IT experience.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Just looking at the team composition, it’s obvious we were a ragtag bunch. Writing this out again, I realize we really were out of our minds. Where did we get that confidence from?</p>\n<p>None of us had ever done web development. Ignorance breeds courage, as they say, and here’s the thing — what this group of people was trying to build was a 3D model editor that runs on the web. And that was just part of the plan; there was even more chaos to come after that. <small>(This project taught me the importance of MVPs during my college years.)</small></p>\n<p>Since I was in charge of frontend, I just dove in headfirst and somehow cobbled things together with JavaScript and jQuery. It was my first time doing anything with graphics, and my first time using <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Three.js</a>, so I struggled quite a bit with the 3D work. But thanks to that, I studied math intensively, and after about three months, I had built a prototype with basic features — loading obj files on the web, changing textures and materials, placing lights to change the atmosphere of the space, and so on.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/6a068/3deditor.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.62500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDAQT/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAUWXLpaSE//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMQERQj/9oACAEBAAEFAuhhLbW2WMYeOP/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAEDAQE/Aaf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEP/aAAgBAgEBPwEJ/8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAAAiFB/9oACAEBAAY/AuzSql//xAAaEAADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMWFB/9oACAEBAAE/IUsvE4Nx0GnsTgRljo3k/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABADH//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ/9oACAEDAQE/EFT/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREh/9oACAECAQE/EESmH//EABoQAAMBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIQBhcTH/2gAIAQEAAT8Qpxwpq+ZPjBZIorzcpxov00e4Fcz3GZTg3//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"3deditor\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/c08c5/3deditor.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/0913d/3deditor.jpg 160w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/cb69c/3deditor.jpg 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/c08c5/3deditor.jpg 640w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/6a068/3deditor.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The nostalgic café next to Hakrim Hall at Dongguk University</small>\n</center>\n<p>At one point, I saw this bald guy more often than my own mother.

This was when I first properly collaborated with people from other roles — not just developers.</p>\n<p>When bugs occurred in programs I built, customers would contact the CS team, and the CS team would report bugs to the dev team. Or I’d share ideas with designers and planners while building products. In college, it was all just side projects with friends, so I only had simple concerns like “how do I build this?” But at a company, it was completely different. Here, I had to think about additional things:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>What risks or benefits might arise from deploying this feature?</li>\n<li>Should we use an external solution to save development time, or build it ourselves with a long-term view?</li>\n<li>If feature A takes about a month to develop, but we could build two other features in that time, what choice should we make?</li>\n<li>We’ve received a lot of VoC (Voice of Customer) related to this feature — how should we solve it to satisfy users?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>At the time, designers, developers, and planners freely exchanged opinions on these issues. That’s when I realized that ultimately, the most important things for a company are <strong>customers</strong> and <strong>money</strong>.</p>\n<p>This might sound obvious. But arriving at this thought has had a huge influence on my values as a developer. Sure, there are many other important things at a company — employee satisfaction, culture, and so on — but customers and money are the fundamentals. No matter how well I build a program, it’s meaningless if no one uses it. And no matter how great a company’s culture and benefits are, if there’s no money, the company will eventually fail. So this was the first time I thought:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even as a developer, only thinking about technical things might be a narrow perspective.\nUltimately, what I’m building is a product that people use, and I should build it for people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From then on, I thought a lot about how becoming a good developer means thinking deeply about business and users too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"are-emotions-unnecessary-in-professional-work\" style=\"position:relative;\">Are Emotions Unnecessary in Professional Work?<a href=\"#are-emotions-unnecessary-in-professional-work\" aria-label=\"are emotions unnecessary in professional work permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I still continue to work at startups. The reason is that I can take on diverse work that wouldn’t be possible at larger companies, and I enjoy freely sharing opinions and deriving rational conclusions through healthy debate.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all good. Since people gather together, there are various events — feelings get hurt between colleagues, conflicts arise between team members and the company. Especially since the atmosphere is so free, we treat each other almost like friends, and occasionally, <strong>mistakes</strong> happen. <small>(Of course, no matter how flat or free the organization is, everyone maintains basic courtesy.)</small></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 540px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 140%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"everyone\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/0913d/everyone.jpg 160w,\n/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/cb69c/everyone.jpg 320w,\n/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg 540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Some mystery meme someone registered.

But lately, I’ve also been thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter how much you try to exclude emotions, isn’t that impossible since we’re all human?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether someone is smart, senior, or junior — they’re all human, so of course there are difficult times and happy times, right? I’ve seen a senior developer dismiss such things as whining and call it unprofessional. Sure, if someone is going around broadcasting their emotions everywhere, that person has issues.

It’s more like “somewhere between coworkers and friends.” It might sound like splitting hairs, but anyway, I don’t think of them as purely professional relationships. We’re all people running hard together toward the same goal, around the same age, and our values aren’t that different either.</p>\n<p>So if a team member is going through emotional difficulties because of something bad that happened, and it’s showing, I think “Isn’t there something I can help with?” rather than criticizing them for bringing emotions to work.</p>\n<p>Helping isn’t even difficult. It’s just casually saying “Whoa, you don’t look so great today. Want to grab a coffee?” then going to a café, listening to them talk, and hanging out for 20-30 minutes. Just doing that much might help the troubled team member organize their thoughts, sort out their emotions by talking to someone, and focus better on work again, right?</p>\n<p>Humans are emotional beings. I don’t think you can understand anything while excluding emotions.

Even freelancers must communicate with clients. A developer who’s simply good at coding won’t be remembered by others as “a developer who’s great to work with.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The person you want to work with isn’t necessarily someone who’s just good at their job.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An attitude that fully respects someone’s opinion during meetings, even if they disagree with me, even if they have less experience, even if they’re an elementary school student.</p>\n<p>An attitude that, when someone is emotionally struggling, helps them recover their pace by listening to their concerns rather than criticizing them for being unprofessional.</p>\n<p>Or an attitude that can at least acknowledge that someone felt a certain emotion, even if you don’t understand it.</p>\n<p>Having these basic attitudes is what allows you to become not just a good developer, but a good colleague, right? Of course, I’m shy by nature, so I’m not exactly a warm person. <small>(I’ve been told since childhood that I give bad first impressions.)</small> But regardless of individual personality, I believe we should at least have respect and consideration for the people we collaborate with. Personally, I think anyone can improve their technical hard skills if they work hard — the speed might differ, but everyone improves. And I believe developers are already putting effort into their technical specs without anyone having to tell them.</p>\n<p>But soft skills like communication and consideration for others are easy to neglect unconsciously unless you pay attention regularly, so I think it’s important to keep reflecting, stay mindful, and maintain an attitude of seeking continuous feedback. Recently, I received feedback from someone on another team that my tone is too stiff and intimidating, which was a bit discouraging. But since then, I’ve been trying to be more mindful of how I speak. I’m not sure if it’s working though… haha</p>\n<p>So these are my thoughts and conclusions so far, after four years of working as a developer and pondering <strong>what makes a good developer</strong>. I still have many more years of work and life ahead, so my current conclusions might change again. But I think “an attitude of consideration for others” remains important whether I’m a developer or doing something else entirely.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190606-what-is-good-programmer-en","path":"/2019/06/06/what-is-good-programmer/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Makes a Good Developer?","subTitle":"Beyond coding skills — reflections on becoming someone others want to work with","date":"Jun 06, 2019","categories":["Essay","Soft Skills"],"tags":["Good Programmer","Developer","Programmer","Soft Skills"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/3a812/3deditor.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/3a812/3deditor.jpg 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/4b287/3deditor.jpg 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/fc5c5/3deditor.webp 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/e9225/3deditor.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/2d839/3deditor.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/2d839/3deditor.jpg 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/b384d/3deditor.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"32c0189b-e19a-5372-9d93-6964b7f2c8bd","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#big-o-notation-and-time-complexity\">Big O Notation and Time Complexity</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#sorting-algorithms\">Sorting Algorithms</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#bubble-sort\">Bubble Sort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#selection-sort\">Selection Sort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#insertion-sort\">Insertion Sort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#merge-sort\">Merge Sort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#quick-sort\">Quick Sort</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"In this post, I want to cover five representative sorting algorithms and provide a rough explanation of Big O notation.

After calling <code class=\"language-text\">50</code>, when your opponent says “higher” or “lower,” you can discard the 50 numbers on the wrong side and only think about the remaining 50.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 306px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/01fdd/drink.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"drink\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/01fdd/drink.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/0913d/drink.jpg 160w,\n/static/8879b1bbc91ecb328b1dc5a32b718efb/01fdd/drink.jpg 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>If you're lucky and your opponent was thinking of 50, the game ends immediately and they have to drink.</small>\n</center>\n<p>Anyway, the worst case in this game is going back and forth with “higher” and “lower” until it ends in <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mi>N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O({\\log}N)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mop\">lo<span style=\"margin-right:0.01389em;\">g</span></span></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">N</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span></span> guesses.

The key is whether you can effectively solve the problem by using the right algorithm for the situation.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine you have a bag containing balls numbered 1 through 10 in random order, and you need to take them out one by one and arrange them from smallest to largest. Most humans can sort these without much difficulty. But computers often deal with <code class=\"language-text\">10,000</code> or even <code class=\"language-text\">10,000,000</code> pieces of data. And databases theoretically need to handle infinite amounts of data.</p>\n<p>If the data isn’t sorted, you’d have to look at each piece of data sequentially while searching. But if the data is already sorted, you can use powerful algorithms like the binary search I mentioned above. <small>(This is actually the biggest reason.)</small></p>\n<p>Now let’s look at the representative sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bubble-sort\" style=\"position:relative;\">Bubble Sort<a href=\"#bubble-sort\" aria-label=\"bubble sort permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<img src=\"/1692a508cdbd24d8651e01ffe00385dd/bubble_sort.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n<p>Bubble sort shows the worst performance in almost every situation, but it shows the best performance on already-sorted data since it only needs to traverse once. You might wonder why you’d sort already-sorted data, but it’s meaningful because the sorting algorithm itself operates without knowing whether the data is sorted or not.</p>\n<p>Bubble sort works in the following order:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Compare and sort the 0th and 1st elements</li>\n<li>Compare and sort the 1st and 2nd elements</li>\n<li>…keep repeating</li>\n<li>Compare and sort the (n-1)th and nth elements</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Each traversal sorts one element at the end, so it looks like bubbles rising — hence the name bubble sort.

Valid for predictions between 1800 AD and 2050 AD. Ignores long-term orbital element variations but is simple and fast to compute.</li>\n<li>Table 2a: Measured using the same reference as Table 1, but valid for predictions between 3000 BC and 3000 AD. Because it covers a wider time range, additional correction terms from Table 2b must be applied for orbital calculations from Jupiter through Neptune.</li>\n<li>Table 2b: Correction terms for the mean anomaly calculations of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in Table 2a. These terms account for gravitational perturbations, interplanetary interactions, and general relativistic effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Tables 2a and 2b are for high-precision calculations needed for things like space exploration. Massive planets like Jupiter have significant gravitational effects on other bodies, requiring separate correction values for better precision.</p>\n<p>Since my goal is just a simple simulation rather than high-precision calculation, the elements from Table 1 are more than sufficient.</p>\n<h3 id=\"examining-the-orbital-element-data\" style=\"position:relative;\">Examining the Orbital Element Data<a href=\"#examining-the-orbital-element-data\" aria-label=\"examining the orbital element data permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Table 1 provides Keplerian element values measured at the epoch J2000 — January 1, 2000, at noon (Julian calendar) — along with the rate of change per century.

But this isn’t a problem.</p>\n<p>For the argument of periapsis — since it simply means how far the perihelion is from the ascending node — it can be calculated from the longitude of perihelion and longitude of the ascending node that we already have. However, in this post we’ll only be finding the planet’s position on the 2D orbital plane, so we don’t actually need to calculate the argument of periapsis (which is used for determining the orbit’s orientation in 3D space).</p>\n<p>As for the time of periapsis passage, it’s essentially a time reference for finding where a planet is located at a given moment. Since the JPL data provides both values measured at J2000 and the rate of change per century, the evolution of orbital elements over time is already accounted for.</p>\n<p>The key to calculating a

Notice that the gray orbital areas are slightly different from each other, while the pink orbital areas are all equal.</p>\n<p>A planet in an elliptical orbit exhibits nonlinear motion according to Kepler’s second law — the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">law of equal areas</a>. That is, the planet moves faster near perihelion and slower near aphelion.</p>\n<p>The mean anomaly represents the angular distance between a body and the perihelion, assuming the body were transferred to a perfect circular orbit while maintaining its orbital speed and period. By simplifying the orbit to a near-circular shape, the angle representing the planet’s position increases linearly with time, making calculations simpler.</p>\n<p>Of course, if a planet’s orbital eccentricity were 0 (a perfect circle), the planet would actually move this way. But since most orbits are elliptical, the mean anomaly and eccentricity are used to correct the calculation and determine the planet’s actual motion.</p>\n<p>The mean anomaly serves as the most fundamental ingredient for calculating a planet’s position in its orbit. There are several ways to compute it, but since I already have the mean longitude and longitude of perihelion, I’ll use those.</p>\n<p>The formula for calculating the mean anomaly from mean longitude (<span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>l</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">l</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.01968em;\">l</span></span></span></span></span>) and longitude of perihelion (<span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">ω</span></span></span></span></span>) is:</p>\n<div class=\"math math-display\"><span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">M = l - \\omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">M</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7778em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.01968em;\">l</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">−</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">ω</span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ts\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-ts line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> meanAnomaly <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> currentElements<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>meanLongitude <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> currentElements<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>perihelionLongitude<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// 6238.776827293419 degrees</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>To understand the principle behind this, we need a bit more context on what mean longitude is.

It represents the central angle when the planet’s position is projected onto an imaginary circular orbit whose radius equals the semi-major axis of the actual elliptical orbit.

So while the diagram above shows Earth standing upright with the Sun orbiting at a tilt, in reality the ecliptic is the reference plane and the celestial equator is the one tilted at 23.5°.</p>\n<h3 id=\"right-ascension-and-declination\" style=\"position:relative;\">Right Ascension and Declination<a href=\"#right-ascension-and-declination\" aria-label=\"right ascension and declination permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The celestial sphere is ultimately a concept for expressing the positions of objects in the sky relative to Earth. The positions of celestial bodies are expressed using right ascension and declination.</p>\n<p>This is the same idea as using the geographic coordinate system with longitude and latitude to express a specific location on Earth. In the geographic coordinate system, latitude takes the equator as 0° and the poles as 90° to mark vertical position, while longitude takes the Greenwich Observatory as 0° and divides 180° east and 180° west for horizontal position.</p>\n<p>By the same principle, when looking up at the sky from Earth, any object on the celestial sphere can be located with just two values — right ascension and declination.</p>\n<p>Right ascension and declination are the longitude and latitude in the equatorial coordinate system, which uses the celestial equator as its baseline. Right ascension measures the counterclockwise angle from the vernal equinox to the target object along the celestial equator. Declination measures the angular distance from the celestial equator to the target object. In short, knowing the celestial equator, the vernal equinox, the right ascension, and the declination is enough to pinpoint any object on the celestial sphere. <small>(Of course, the equatorial coordinate system assumes objects exist on the two-dimensional surface of the celestial sphere, so it doesn’t define the distance to the object.)</small></p>\n<p>An interesting fact is that most celestial bodies — except for solar system objects and comets — barely move on the celestial sphere, so they have essentially fixed right ascension and declination values that make them easy to locate.</p>\n<p>Unlike geographic longitude, right ascension in the equatorial coordinate system is expressed in time units like hours and minutes. Since Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours, 1 hour of right ascension corresponds to 15°. Declination takes the celestial equator as 0° and defines the celestial north pole as +90° and south pole as -90°, so it always falls between -90° and +90°.</p>\n<p>For reference, the coordinate system centered on a ground-level observer on Earth (rather than the equator), using the observer’s horizon as the reference plane, is called the horizontal coordinate system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"orbital-terminology\" style=\"position:relative;\">Orbital Terminology<a href=\"#orbital-terminology\" aria-label=\"orbital terminology permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"ascending-node--descending-node\" style=\"position:relative;\">Ascending Node / Descending Node<a href=\"#ascending-node--descending-node\" aria-label=\"ascending node  descending node permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>A celestial body’s orbital plane is generally tilted relative to a reference plane.
