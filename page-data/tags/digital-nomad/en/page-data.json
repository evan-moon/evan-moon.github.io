When German forces invaded during WWII, Czech didn’t fight the Nazis and surrendered early, so unlike other countries’ cities, many cultural heritage sites remain intact without destruction. That’s why Prague still retains much of its medieval European appearance rather than modern looks. The Old Town with Prague’s Old Square is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, showing how deep its history runs.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/47cd6dd3a80df9f1899a8dbac7eb83e8/e5166/prague1.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"prague1\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/47cd6dd3a80df9f1899a8dbac7eb83e8/c08c5/prague1.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/47cd6dd3a80df9f1899a8dbac7eb83e8/0913d/prague1.jpg 160w,\n/static/47cd6dd3a80df9f1899a8dbac7eb83e8/cb69c/prague1.jpg 320w,\n/static/47cd6dd3a80df9f1899a8dbac7eb83e8/c08c5/prague1.jpg 640w,\n/static/47cd6dd3a80df9f1899a8dbac7eb83e8/6a068/prague1.jpg 960w,\n/static/47cd6dd3a80df9f1899a8dbac7eb83e8/e5166/prague1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The Charles Bridge area has nothing but old buildings</small>\n</center>\n<p>The currency isn’t the euro but <code class=\"language-text\">koruna (Kč)</code> - the exchange rate fluctuates around 50-53 won per koruna. I’m living here thinking roughly <code class=\"language-text\">200 koruna == 10,000 won</code>. And since prices are cheap for Europe, living expenses come out about the same as Korea.</p>\n<p>However, since it’s Europe there’s a 7-hour time difference from Korea, so people like me who brought work from Korea might need to wake up a bit early in the morning for communication. <small>(For reference, Prague is UTC +02:00)</small></p>\n<p>I naturally woke up early at first due to jet lag, but after about 3 days I’m reverting to my Korean life pattern and finding it harder to wake up early.</p>\n<p>And the language is Czech, a Slavic language. Czech has some similarities to English but more differences, so without separate study it’s hard to understand or read. Since I wasn’t going to properly study Czech and didn’t have time, I just came without thinking. But since I came to Czech anyway, I wanted to try using Czech, so I memorized just a few simple sentences and am working hard combining them.</p>\n<p>One tip: after first memorizing basic phrases like <code class=\"language-text\">thank you (Děkuji)</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">hello (Dobrý den)</code>, definitely memorize <code class=\"language-text\">I don't understand (Nerozumím)</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Do you speak English? (Mluvíte anglicky?)</code> next. This way you give locals a good first impression by using the local language and can also get help in English. Same anywhere you go - nobody looks badly on foreigners trying to use their language even if clumsily. <small>(Got complimented by a passing grandpa at the mart for saying děkuji)</small></p>\n<p>Now let me talk about several things I experienced while staying here these few days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-macbook-pro-retina-flight-restrictions\" style=\"position:relative;\">About MacBook Pro Retina Flight Restrictions<a href=\"#about-macbook-pro-retina-flight-restrictions\" aria-label=\"about macbook pro retina flight restrictions permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This is something I only learned the day before departure that flustered me a bit - not specific to Prague but I’ll mention it in case some don’t know.</p>\n<p>Some MacBook Pro Retina models manufactured between 2015-2017 had several explosion accidents due to battery defects. So starting August 2019, when boarding planes operated by EU member airlines, you cannot transport MacBook Pros as checked baggage - you must bring them as carry-on. And you absolutely cannot turn them on during flight.</p>\n<p>For non-EU countries, some airlines banned bringing MacBook Pros on planes entirely, so check carefully before boarding. In my case, since I came to the EU I could bring it, but since I don’t know how regulations might change when returning to Korea, I brought my safe 2009 MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>When I directly inquired with Czech Airlines, I received a reply that it’s fine as long as I don’t power it on during flight, but who knows how the situation might change later. Due to the nature of airline safety regulations directly tied to passenger lives, if just one or two more MacBook Pro battery explosion accidents occur, regulations could change without grace period.</p>\n<p>Plus, if denied entry in Korea I could at least send it home by delivery, but if denied when returning from Czech it becomes difficult to handle, so I chose to bring the 2009 MacBook even though it’s a bit frustrating.</p>\n<p>For details, see this <a href=\"https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0104_201908141632359132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">related article</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"are-prices-cheap\" style=\"position:relative;\">Are Prices Cheap?<a href=\"#are-prices-cheap\" aria-label=\"are prices cheap permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>What I learned while researching before coming to Prague was that Czech prices are cheaper than expected. Of course, “cheap” means cheap for Europe - not that it’s incredibly cheap compared to Korea. But overall prices do feel cheaper than Korea.</p>\n<p>However, foreign prices mean some specific items might be cheaper than Korea while others are more expensive, so after actually living here a few days, I didn’t feel that big a difference from Korea. Food ingredients are definitely cheaper than Korea, but electrical products like power strips were much more expensive than Korea. <small>(Power strips cost over 10,000 won…)</small></p>\n<p>Since I’m not good at cooking, I mainly buy food outside or buy instant food from marts - in this case, I spend about the same amount as Korea. Like buying a hamburger at McDonald’s costs about 5,000 won, buying a sandwich on the street costs about 3,000 won.</p>\n<p>And before leaving, a friend said “water in Europe is super expensive” which scared me, but buying at Tesco, a 1.5L water bottle only costs about <code class=\"language-text\">600 won</code>.</p>\n<p>By the way, bottled water has blue packaging saying <code class=\"language-text\">Neperlivá Voda</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">Ne</code> means not, <code class=\"language-text\">perlivá</code> means sparkling, <code class=\"language-text\">Voda</code> means water. In other words, <code class=\"language-text\">Neperlivá Voda</code> means non-sparkling water. For those who don’t like carbonated water, take note.</p>\n<p>What I definitely felt was cheaper than Korea was transportation costs - paying about 35,000 won for monthly transportation lets you use public transit unlimitedly. Since I spend nearly 70,000 won monthly just on transportation in Korea, transportation is definitely cheaper than Korea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"english-doesnt-work-as-well-as-expected\" style=\"position:relative;\">English Doesn’t Work as Well as Expected<a href=\"#english-doesnt-work-as-well-as-expected\" aria-label=\"english doesnt work as well as expected permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Actually, I thought since Prague is a famous tourist destination, people would all speak English well. But outside areas where tourists mainly go - Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, Old Square - English doesn’t work as well as expected.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s not like Asian countries like Japan or China where they don’t understand at all, but if you speak too fast or use too complex vocabulary, they don’t understand well. And older people tend to speak less English than younger people.</p>\n<p>And similar to Korea, going to large marts like Tesco, product names and section signs are all written only in Czech so you might get lost. On my first day I bought something labeled <code class=\"language-text\">Mléko</code> thinking it was milk, but it turned out to be yogurt milk. <small>(I realized after pouring it on cereal)</small></p>\n<p>If you’re staying long like me, studying basic words or phonics before coming to Czech would help. I trusted only English and came, and am now suffering quite a bit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-around-on-public-transport\" style=\"position:relative;\">Getting Around on Public Transport<a href=\"#getting-around-on-public-transport\" aria-label=\"getting around on public transport permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Prague’s public transport includes buses, trams, and subways. I personally think trams or subways are more convenient than buses. You can use public transport with tickets or a Lítačka card like Korea’s T-money, but Lítačka cards must be issued at city hall and require submitting passport photos so it’s bothersome. So I just bought a monthly ticket and am using it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tickets-operate-on-a-time-system\" style=\"position:relative;\">Tickets Operate on a Time System<a href=\"#tickets-operate-on-a-time-system\" aria-label=\"tickets operate on a time system permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Prague’s tickets aren’t distance-based like Korea but time-based. After buying a ticket, you put it in a weird machine called a punching machine and stamp the usage start time. In other words, if you buy a 90-minute ticket, from the stamped usage start time for 90 minutes you can freely transfer between trams, subways, whatever.</p>\n<p>But if time passes while your body is still on public transport and you get caught by inspectors, you’re getting fined without exception. By the way, fare evasion fines must be paid in cash - <code class=\"language-text\">800Kč</code> if paid on the spot, <code class=\"language-text\">1,500Kč</code> if you need to withdraw cash from an ATM.</p>\n<p>Looking at blog reviews, quite many people got fined for not punching tickets. But after actually riding trams and subways myself, I thought such mistakes are understandable.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/166af615eebd2c8f2954d03c181321c2/c08c5/metro.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBf/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABzqoG4rCYP//EABgQAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxAy/9oACAEBAAEFAp9UmQquygDf/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQMBAT8Bqv/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEiH/2gAIAQIBAT8BTtkv/8QAGhABAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAQEiFBUf/aAAgBAQAGPwLSEcUfZymv/8QAGxABAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAREDFRYZH/2gAIAQEAAT8hTU5JYxLGkpg17LgRfW8f/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDPD//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEAAf/aAAgBAwEBPxDMBK//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABH/2gAIAQIBAT8QXCS7qX//xAAcEAEBAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhUWExcZH/2gAIAQEAAT8QhsNF6nfOAdEYbDreeQ8oHH3Fiys4zSSwkc+8SLn/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"metro\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/166af615eebd2c8f2954d03c181321c2/c08c5/metro.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/166af615eebd2c8f2954d03c181321c2/0913d/metro.jpg 160w,\n/static/166af615eebd2c8f2954d03c181321c2/cb69c/metro.jpg 320w,\n/static/166af615eebd2c8f2954d03c181321c2/c08c5/metro.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>You just walk between those pillars</small>\n</center>\n<p>One thing that flustered me when first arriving in Prague was that there’s no mechanical ticket-checking system when using public transport.

The carrier is detected and <code class=\"language-text\">Vodafone CZ LTE</code> shows in the status bar, but actual internet connection is blocked.</p>\n<p>The SIM case has the activation method written, so just read carefully and follow… but that’s a bit ambiguous because this method is written in Czech. If you can use WiFi, just run it through a translator, but if you can’t use WiFi, just ask carrier employees for help. I naturally assumed it would be in English and boldly just left, then grabbed a passerby in the middle of the street asking for help.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Vodafone’s SIM activation method is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>When the SIM activates, Vodafone sends a formal activation congratulations message with a password.</li>\n<li>Call <code class=\"language-text\">*77</code>. Don’t panic if Czech comes out. Pressing <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> lets you proceed in English.</li>\n<li>Enter the password confirmed in step 1.</li>\n<li>They explain about fees and taxes - you can just hang up.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem is this doesn’t activate immediately but takes some time. The carrier employee said 10 minutes would do, but it took me a bit over 3 hours. And when the SIM activates, the sent message also includes a link to check remaining data and services in use, so don’t delete the message.</p>\n<p>If this still doesn’t work, check the APN settings once. In my case, I once set the APN to a local carrier when I went to Japan before, and when returning to Korea and resetting, the APN was set to <code class=\"language-text\">lte.sktelecom.com</code>. If another carrier’s APN is hard-coded like this, naturally internet won’t work so delete that value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pay-in-local-currency-when-using-cards\" style=\"position:relative;\">Pay in Local Currency When Using Cards<a href=\"#pay-in-local-currency-when-using-cards\" aria-label=\"pay in local currency when using cards permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I’m currently going around Prague trusting basically only my Kakao check card.

So there’s an advantage of seeing at a glance how much I spent.</p>\n<p>But the problem is that besides overseas payment fees, a DCC fee is additionally attached so fees double. Plus, the exchange rate applied when changing local currency to won favors merchants and banks over customers, so it’s best to avoid when possible.</p>\n<p>For Kakao check cards, there’s a setting in the Kakao Bank app to simply block overseas won payment, so turning on that option prevents double fee charges from won payment.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/c2398664b2677f152b64ddc23a7b5655/acb04/kakao_dcc_blocking.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 48.75000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"kakao dcc blocking\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/c2398664b2677f152b64ddc23a7b5655/c08c5/kakao_dcc_blocking.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/c2398664b2677f152b64ddc23a7b5655/0913d/kakao_dcc_blocking.jpg 160w,\n/static/c2398664b2677f152b64ddc23a7b5655/cb69c/kakao_dcc_blocking.jpg 320w,\n/static/c2398664b2677f152b64ddc23a7b5655/c08c5/kakao_dcc_blocking.jpg 640w,\n/static/c2398664b2677f152b64ddc23a7b5655/acb04/kakao_dcc_blocking.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Can easily set in Card &gt; My Card &gt; Card Management</small>\n</center>\n<p>But the real problem is most stores don’t have employees receive cards and process payments - customers directly insert cards into payment machines themselves.

Fortunately WiFi works great at home so I could work from home, but since I came abroad anyway, I’m working at coworking spaces to talk with developers from other countries.</p>\n<p>Since Prague has quite many people coming for digital nomading from other countries, there are quite a few coworking spaces. And most coworking spaces provide day passes for single-day use, so I recommend visiting several places to scout out good ones.</p>\n<p>I picked out several Prague coworking spaces on <a href=\"https://www.coworker.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coworker.com</a> and visit whenever I have time. Generally daily fees are about <code class=\"language-text\">200Kč</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">300Kč</code>. I think compared to cafes, coworking spaces are good because you get opportunities to network with developers from other countries and can freely use water, coffee, and bathrooms. <small>(In Europe you pay for bathrooms.
