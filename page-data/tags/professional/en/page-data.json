It’s actually a question I’ve been carrying since I first started coding.

After about five years of working as a frontend developer across various organizations, I’d received all sorts of feedback from colleagues. Some generous souls would say things like “Evan is really good at frontend,” and I could never bring myself to confidently reply “Why yes, I am.”</p>\n<p>The reason is simply that I don’t think I’m good at frontend development. And I don’t trust the subjective assessments others assign to me. What I’ve always wanted — and still want — is to be a “good developer” with objective, universally acknowledged value.</p>\n<p>People’s standards differ, of course, but I think “being good” by objective standards means having mastered a body of knowledge. And if you ask whether I’ve mastered frontend development, the answer is obviously “no.” There’s still so much I don’t know, and I spend every day fumbling through new problems and praying to the Google gods.</p>\n<p>So for six years, I’ve been wrestling with: “What is true knowledge?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-was-a-good-developer\" style=\"position:relative;\">I “Was” a Good Developer<a href=\"#i-was-a-good-developer\" aria-label=\"i was a good developer permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I didn’t always have this existential crisis.

Here’s the question I want to pose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are frontend developers and markup engineers the same position?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For context: in the Korean tech industry, “publisher” (퍼블리셔) is a common title for specialists who primarily handle HTML/CSS markup. This distinction between “frontend developer” and “markup engineer” exists in many tech ecosystems under different names — “HTML/CSS developer,” “UI developer,” “web designer who codes,” etc.</p>\n<p>If you work in this industry, you probably have opinions about these roles and how they differ. Let me push the question further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can you distinguish between these two positions?\nIf so, what criteria do you use?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I’m really asking is: what’s the clear, definitive line between the two?</p>\n<p>Both positions build web clients. Yet people draw fairly rigid distinctions between them. So presumably, they know how to tell them apart.</p>\n<p>Generally, a frontend developer is someone who writes client programs that run in web browsers — defining DOM structures with HTML, exchanging data with backend systems using JavaScript, building standalone client applications, and sometimes crafting elegant UI/UX with CSS.</p>\n<p>But laid out like that, it sounds a lot like what a markup engineer does too. In fact, when you look at actual day-to-day work, they’re often identical.</p>\n<p>Some say markup engineers aren’t frontend developers because they don’t know React or Vue. But then what about the people who used to build complex web clients with jQuery? Were they markup engineers? Yet the industry clearly recognized the title “frontend developer” at that time — I was called one myself.</p>\n<p>Others say markup engineers lack the JavaScript or computer science knowledge that frontend developers have. Okay, then let me ask this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much JavaScript does a markup engineer need to know to be called a frontend developer?\nDoes simply acquiring CS knowledge instantly make someone a frontend developer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where answers diverge. Some might say you need to understand closures.

In an era still governed by mythological thinking, oracles carried the weight of law. But Socrates refused to believe it and resolved to find someone wiser than himself.</p>\n<p>From then on, Socrates went around questioning the Sophists — the highly-paid intellectual elite — to gauge how wise they truly were. If we map Socrates’ line of questioning onto our earlier topic, it would go something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What is a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: Someone who has the knowledge needed to build web clients and can actually implement them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then isn’t a markup engineer also a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: No.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What’s the difference between the two?\n<strong>A</strong>: I’d say markup engineers have less computer science knowledge than frontend developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So if a markup engineer studies computer science, do they become a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: I think they’d also need to get hired as a frontend developer to truly be called one.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So the position assigned by a company matters?\n<strong>A</strong>: …I suppose so.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then if a frontend developer at a prestigious tech company takes a markup engineer position at a web agency, are they a frontend developer or a markup engineer?\n<strong>A</strong>: … (contradiction)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was Socrates’ method. He’d ask fundamental questions, and when someone answered, he’d probe the inconsistencies in their response with follow-up questions. After a few rounds, the Sophists would hit a wall — realizing that what they “knew” was actually flawed. They’d become flustered or angry.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 59.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ship\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/0913d/ship.jpg 160w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/cb69c/ship.jpg 320w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg 640w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This state of being shipwrecked on contradictions and impasses is called \"aporia\"</small>\n</center>\n<p>After visiting Sophist after Sophist and finding that none could fully withstand his questioning, Socrates concluded: “These people don’t truly know anything.”</p>\n<p>What about you?

But if Socrates came at me with questions like those, I’d probably answer earnestly for a while before inevitably falling into aporia myself.</p>\n<p>And this method of questioning wasn’t just for the Sophists — Socrates applied it to himself too. After repeating this process over and over, he arrived at a single realization:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only thing I know is that I know nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a statement directed at himself as much as at the Sophists. Neither you nor I truly know anything — but at least I know that I don’t know.</p>\n<p>And Socrates’ conclusion isn’t wrong, either. You have to acknowledge your ignorance before you can pursue deeper truth. Someone who thinks “I already know this” won’t dig any deeper into the subject.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the Sophists didn’t take kindly to Socrates’ attitude. He was eventually charged with “corrupting the youth and undermining Athenian traditions.”</p>\n<p>He could have survived the trial by playing politics and talking his way out, but Socrates refused to bend his convictions. He gave a provocative defense that antagonized the jury, effectively sealing his own fate with a death sentence. <del>(He could have applied for exile to another city-state, but he chose to drink the poison instead — a true hard case…)</del></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"socrates\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/0913d/socrates.jpg 160w,\n/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/cb69c/socrates.jpg 320w,\n/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>In the end, this man chose the hemlock</small>\n</center>\n<p>Even someone as brilliant as Socrates, after all that deliberation, arrived at “I know nothing.” It’s an almost absurdly anticlimactic conclusion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After this long exploration, my question has merely shifted from “What is knowledge?” to “Do we truly know the things we think we know?” — without actually finding an answer.</p>\n<p>I suppose it makes sense that I can’t easily answer a question that even Socrates — counted among the great sages of history — could only resolve with such an empty-sounding conclusion.
