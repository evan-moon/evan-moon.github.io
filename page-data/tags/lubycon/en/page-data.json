At the time, the frontend position in the Insurtech silo was vacant, so when work requiring frontend came up, either the product designer did markup directly or we got support from frontend developers in other silos.</p>\n<p>Those expectations felt a bit burdensome, but everyone helped me adapt well and made me comfortable, so I could quickly follow up on past history and get involved in the Insurtech silo’s goals.</p>\n<p>Also, the Toss team is quite lenient about failure compared to other organizations, and the speed of learning from these failures and applying them to the next challenge is very fast. For this reason, working here means the ideation, decision-making, development, deployment, and result analysis iterations repeat endlessly, making it fun but quite hectic.</p>\n<p>That might be why this year flew by faster than usual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleaning-up-legacy-code\" style=\"position:relative;\">Cleaning Up Legacy Code<a href=\"#cleaning-up-legacy-code\" aria-label=\"cleaning up legacy code permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>My first product when I joined was an insurance-related internal product. At the time, this product didn’t even have TDS (Toss Design System) attached, was developed so urgently that the internal design wasn’t solid, and had development environment differences from other Toss products — there was a lot to improve.</p>\n<p>When I first take on a product, I look through its commit history. Looking at commit history tells you how the product was developed following business context, and roughly what design direction the developer before me was trying to take.</p>\n<p>After looking at this product’s commit history, my first thought was “the schedule was f***ing tight…” Usually with commits you can group them by feature — commits for feature A, commits for feature B — but this product had very short gaps between developing one feature and the next, and sometimes multiple features were developed in a single day.</p>\n<p>But as always, you can’t carve out time for refactoring when you’re busy developing features to keep up with rapidly changing business context, so I had no choice but to refactor bit by bit following the <a href=\"https://johngrib.github.io/wiki/Boy-Scout-Rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boy Scout Rule</a>.</p>\n<p>My refactoring goal at the time was simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make it so any frontend developer at Toss could take over this product without feeling out of place!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I handled this product from December last year to August this year — roughly 9 months. The seemingly endless refactoring showed some results just by doing it steadily.</p>\n<p>When I first arrived, deployment was done by manually running scripts, but now the process of developing features, raising PRs, and running CI/CD matches other Toss products, so other frontend developers can develop features and deploy in the same development environment.</p>\n<p>Also, this product’s domain characteristic was complex models, naturally making client state very complex too. At the time, all this complex state was managed with context, so context was a messy mix of state-holding objects, <code class=\"language-text\">dispatch</code> functions for state changes, functions for async processing, reducers, etc.</p>\n<p>So I introduced Redux, which Toss uses a lot, separated async processing functions into middleware, and split stores by data domain to make them somewhat easier to understand. The Redux introduction itself wasn’t high difficulty, and even with Redux the state complexity is still high, but I think matching the development environment with other Toss products has more significance.</p>\n<p>There was also a problem synchronizing server state and client state. When initially developing this product, there wasn’t much time, so it was developed using a Poll method that called the API once per second. So state changes happened once per second, and worse, many components shared this state through Prop drilling based on Context, causing unnecessary rendering once per second too.</p>\n<p>So I tried to improve rendering performance using Redux and react-redux hooks and change the API Poll to a Push method. But ultimately I only finished the Redux introduction and rendering optimization before this product left my hands.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, when I mentioned this to the FE developer who took over this product, they empathized with the direction I was trying to take, and recently finished the refactoring by removing the Poll method and changing to Push. <small>(Thanks to them, I took one burden off my mind)</small></p>\n<p>Of course there are still many disappointing parts, but it feels good that it improved a lot compared to the beginning. I left at dawn several times because of this product and struggled whenever developing features, but I worked on it with affection for 9 months, so it became… a kind of love-hate relationship.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sig-weekend-work-channel\" style=\"position:relative;\">#sig-weekend-work Channel<a href=\"#sig-weekend-work-channel\" aria-label=\"sig weekend work channel permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Besides work, I also do toy projects and write blog posts, so on weekends I often gather with friends at nice cafes to eat delicious food and work together.

After about an hour of heated discussion, we aligned our directions and defined the channel interface — quite a fun memory.</p>\n<p>Also, going to a Turkish restaurant in Songdo with weekend work members where we were the only Koreans felt like we were abroad, and playing billiards betting at the billiards hall behind the office after work was fun too.</p>\n<p>Recently as COVID got serious, we stopped meeting on weekends like before, but when COVID recedes, I think this channel will reactivate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"one-direction-various-methods\" style=\"position:relative;\">One Direction, Various Methods<a href=\"#one-direction-various-methods\" aria-label=\"one direction various methods permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Working at any company, you face moments requiring decisions.

So I live whipping myself daily saying “still not enough.” This is less about my passion being great and more about fearing that the moment I think “I did well enough,” I’ll stop making efforts to grow. <small>(Eventually this led to burnout, but habits don’t change easily…)</small></p>\n<p>One thing I felt during this mentoring: I apply this standard not just to myself but to others too.</p>\n<p>Regardless of skill level, I think we must constantly strive for growth. And to make such consistent effort, goal-setting and motivation must be clear.</p>\n<p>So before becoming a developer, I tried experiencing various things — b-boying, composing, sound engineering, programming — to find “something I can do reasonably well while enjoying.”</p>\n<p>This was how I grew, so naturally I thought this was the right method. Rather than just thinking with your head, move your body to try as many challenges as possible, see results, judge, then continue the next challenge. So when mentoring, I often told mentees these things.</p>\n<p>When mentees said they struggled with the project because of work, or felt frustrated that skills weren’t improving, I didn’t really understand. Honestly, I thought it was just lack of passion and motivation. So I always told mentees things like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hey, I did it, so there’s absolutely no reason you can’t. Try challenging it, and if it really doesn’t work, let’s talk again then!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Of course you lack time for toy projects while working. You need to create time yourself, even by reducing sleep.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Skills absolutely can’t improve quickly in the short term, so don’t be anxious. Just keep at it consistently and you’ll grow at some point. So you should cultivate the habit of coding even a little each day. Endure even if it’s hard.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 512px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/36dd4/whipper.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"whipper\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/36dd4/whipper.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/0913d/whipper.jpg 160w,\n/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/cb69c/whipper.jpg 320w,\n/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/36dd4/whipper.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This wasn't mentoring, it was professional whipping</small>\n</center>\n<p>I don’t think what I said then was wrong. You can’t reduce work hours just because you lack physical time to invest in personal growth due to work, so reducing sleep is a reasonable method. And the easiest way to improve skills is consistently training even a little daily, overcoming the feeling of difficulty and reluctance.</p>\n<p>After 3 months of mentoring, we had a final retrospective, and the frontend developer from the team I mentored said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I reduced sleep to do the toy project as you suggested, but lack of sleep kept making me lose focus and my physical condition worsened 😢</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t show it, but hearing this felt like getting hit in the head with a hammer. That’s when I thought “Ah, I just had better stamina than them to handle that crazy schedule.”</p>\n<p>Learning methods that work efficiently differ per person, but I just pushed what I’d done for the past 6 years thinking it was right. Of course, growth methods similar to mine work well for some people, but at least those I mentored weren’t people for whom this method worked well.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, what I missed as a mentor was empathy and difference. When mentees said they were struggling, I didn’t empathize with the problem and try to solve it together. I just dismissed those as whining or amateurism, emphasizing only properly finishing the project even if pushing themselves to the extreme. <small>(And I felt like an old fogy realizing this, so I was depressed for a while)</small></p>\n<p>If you repeatedly don’t work because it’s hard, teammates’ trust will gradually disappear. This team has only one frontend, backend, and designer each, so if even one person doesn’t work, the project drops. Have responsibility. Give trust to colleagues. Along with these words.</p>\n<p>These words are hard to call wrong, but a mentor who only pushes this way isn’t a good mentor — just a scolding teacher. A mentor should be able to maintain mentees’ morale and motivation to some degree, but I focused too much on launching the project itself.</p>\n<p>So until last month I kept pondering answers to this problem. At the company I also received feedback to “become someone who thinks about not just individual growth but team growth,” making me want to find answers even more.</p>\n<p>But I still don’t really know. Just empathizing unconditionally won’t help mentees grow, and just whipping doesn’t help either.</p>\n<p>Ultimately you need to understand what growth methods work for the person, give appropriate motivation and advice, and bring out their potential. But analyzing people, not computers, is still too difficult for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"everyones-rolled-a-lot\" style=\"position:relative;\">Everyone’s Rolled A Lot…<a href=\"#everyones-rolled-a-lot\" aria-label=\"everyones rolled a lot permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I’d done retrospectives on things the Lubycon team did before, but never really thought about retrospecting the team itself. Recently as things to do together with these friends increased, some new thoughts started emerging.</p>\n<p>While running the mentoring project mentioned earlier, I properly took on work with friends for the first time in a while. Working with friends like this, the feeling I recently felt was “Everyone’s really rolled a lot…” <small>(Belatedly realizing this)</small></p>\n<p>Now most have 5-6 years of experience as working professionals, but thinking back to university days, this team was just a total rookie gathering. More like a friend group than a toy project team. We didn’t know how to collaborate properly and fought all the time.</p>\n<p>Of course, during semester or vacation we gathered daily in Dongguk University Panya Hall basement to ideate, develop, and design together, but back then it was more fun just hanging out with them than developing. Going to PC rooms to crush some games, drinking, billiards, karaoke, sometimes cursing each other out.</p>\n<p>Then this year suddenly the team got busy with lots of work and collaboration increased dramatically. Watching everyone smoothly solve problems popping up everywhere felt a bit strange. In my memory, Lubycon was a team that did lots of fumbling and spent all day googling because we didn’t know methods, but at some point working in this team started feeling similar to working at the office with such smooth progress.</p>\n<p>Recently there was a major accident where the DB table containing mentoring project applicant data got deleted while deploying a serverless framework application, but later we found out the friend in the DevOps role had been continuously backing up, so it passed without incident. When friction arose from project direction or Lubycon team agenda — macroscopic values — not syncing, I remember we also coordinated opinions well and solved it.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/e996b/lubycon3.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"lubycon3\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/6af66/lubycon3.png\" srcset=\"/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/69538/lubycon3.png 160w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/72799/lubycon3.png 320w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/6af66/lubycon3.png 640w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/d9199/lubycon3.png 960w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/e996b/lubycon3.png 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Let's make backups a lifestyle... that terrifying day's memory</small>\n</center>\n<p>Though each walked slightly different paths, rolling in the field for 6 years makes now being more grown than university days natural.

Since this was my first time mentoring, I didn’t know giving someone attention and leading them required so many resources.</p>\n<p>Until now I was a developer who only took care of my own growth. I thought each person’s growth, whether soft skills or hard skills, was something each person had to manage. Then individual growth would lead to team growth. If a teammate didn’t grow as much as others, of course you should help your best, but if they still can’t keep up even with help, ultimately cutting them off was right.</p>\n<p>But during this mentoring, doubts started sprouting that this thinking might be wrong. Just vaguely helping isn’t the answer. Depending on who leads and mentors how, this person’s potential could burst out or die right there.</p>\n<p>As I gradually build my career, I could become someone’s mentor, someone’s role model, or a leader of some team. I think it’s time for deep contemplation on whether I can properly perform that role when the situation comes.</p>\n<p>I can’t be a developer who only looks after my own growth forever. Now I need to look after not just myself but organizational growth too.</p>\n<p>So recently I’ve been talking with fellow developers about topics like “What is a senior developer?”, got recommended and am reading the book <a href=\"http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/67350256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Growing Together</a>, but haven’t found answers on what methods are right yet.</p>\n<p>In 2020 I end this retrospective with questions I couldn’t answer. But for my 2021 retrospective next year, I’ll set a goal to find answers to these questions and concerns and write them in the retrospective.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20201229-2020-retrospective-en","path":"/2020/12/29/2020-retrospective/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2020, How Did I Grow?

But the important thing is that organizations don’t just want developers who are good at programming “alone.”</p>\n<p>Except in early-stage startups or freelance situations, most developers don’t work alone.

It’s a kind of test environment.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/3a4f1/test.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 47.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"test\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/6af66/test.png\" srcset=\"/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/69538/test.png 160w,\n/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/72799/test.png 320w,\n/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/6af66/test.png 640w,\n/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/d9199/test.png 960w,\n/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/21b4d/test.png 1280w,\n/static/71d8f510466db4deb278e4f0ad34b95e/3a4f1/test.png 2588w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Just like you control potential risks in test environments before production,<br>test methodologies in toy projects before applying them at work</small>\n</center>\n<p>Once you’ve gained enough experience with a new technology through a project and determined it’s a worthy tool, you can propose adopting that tech at your workplace based on that experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-its-definitely-not-easy\" style=\"position:relative;\">But It’s Definitely Not Easy<a href=\"#but-its-definitely-not-easy\" aria-label=\"but its definitely not easy permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>However, no matter how simple the product you’re building, when you actually try it you’ll realize it’s not that simple. You chose toy projects to learn soft skills, but as the project progresses, problems often arise precisely because team members lack soft skills.</p>\n<p>Many people worry about their lack of hard skills before starting toy projects, but actually, even if hard skills are lacking, you can somehow study and build a product, so hard skill deficiency surprisingly doesn’t become a big problem for project progress.</p>\n<p>Of course, if your hard skills are significantly behind other team members and it’s hindering the project, you obviously need to work your ass off to catch up. But at least you can improve your skills through effort, so it’s not a major constraint.</p>\n<p>But when soft skills are lacking, it’s a bit different. As I mentioned, soft skills are learned through experience, so the learning process necessarily involves some trial and error and failure.</p>\n<p>The problem isn’t the trial and error itself — it’s that during this process, the group itself is likely to fizzle out.</p>\n<p>Plus, unlike work where you get paid, toy projects offer no compensation, meaning members have zero responsibility to the project. It’s 100% dependent on intrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>The things that show up in college group project horror stories (which have become a meme at this point) — “dumping all the work on competent people,” “no-show at meetings,” “not finishing assigned tasks” — naturally appear in toy projects too. And unlike group projects where grades prevent you from quitting, people actually leave toy project teams.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ef2dd2c91a4e6736460aeaeff01dc43b/80e3c/team_play.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"team play\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ef2dd2c91a4e6736460aeaeff01dc43b/c08c5/team_play.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ef2dd2c91a4e6736460aeaeff01dc43b/0913d/team_play.jpg 160w,\n/static/ef2dd2c91a4e6736460aeaeff01dc43b/cb69c/team_play.jpg 320w,\n/static/ef2dd2c91a4e6736460aeaeff01dc43b/c08c5/team_play.jpg 640w,\n/static/ef2dd2c91a4e6736460aeaeff01dc43b/80e3c/team_play.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Sad but relatable group project meme...</small>\n</center>\n<p>These problems can seriously damage project progress, but as you can tell from how people bond over group project horror stories, they’re not uncommon.</p>\n<p>To keep the group healthy, you need active effort and improvement from members to solve these problems.

Each member has different values and working styles, so we’ve fought for hours over how to solve problems, lost all passion when poorly-defined MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) dragged development out too long, had work pile up on specific people, and even had members leave. Every problem that happens in other communities has happened in Lubycon too — and still happens now.</p>\n<p>But over about six years, going through these various problems, we’ve gradually learned how to solve them together. That’s why we want to share these problem-solving experiences with others.</p>\n<p>That’s why the mentoring project I’m currently running isn’t about development or design — it focuses purely on soft skills like communication, collaboration methodologies, and even individual time management.</p>\n<p>Of course, I’m not some great person who’s qualified to teach anyone.
