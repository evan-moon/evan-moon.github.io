So in this post I want to reflect on what I felt while working at this company over the past 2 years and how things have changed compared to when I first joined.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>When I first joined this company, it was a new startup with about 13 employees that hadn’t received Series A investment yet, but now it’s become a company that received about 12 billion won in Series B investment with around 50 employees. This was my first time experiencing a company grow like this, so there were fun parts, but I also felt nostalgic for when the company was smaller watching the company culture and organizational atmosphere change as the organization grew.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I’m quitting the company today for rest and recharge, so let me reflect from memories of when I joined to today, 2 years later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-legacy-code-i-created\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Legacy Code I Created<a href=\"#the-legacy-code-i-created\" aria-label=\"the legacy code i created permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Before joining this company, I was an idle developer who spectacularly failed a startup with someone I knew and was playing around making various toy projects alone for about 2 months. One day, while coding alone at my regular cafe in Hongdae, some strange foreign guy sent me an interview offer message on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>After exchanging a few words, the service he was making seemed interesting, and the company’s atmosphere and vision seemed to match me well, so I interviewed the next week and got hired on the spot right after the interview ended. The only Q&#x26;A from that time I still remember is this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>CTO</strong>: Can you do VueJS by any chance? We’re trying to make something like this… <small>(showing components from another service)</small></p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: I’ve barely used Vue… but I think I can make it if I study personally while working.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thinking back after the interview, I thought “what did these people even see in me to hire me…?” - but I could understand the current situation on my first day. First, I was this company’s first frontend developer. The CTO had been operating an existing Django-only project and felt the need for a frontend framework, tried introducing React once but failed, and as a fallback somehow got Vue barely working.</p>\n<p>But since the CTO was a backend developer at the time, they wanted someone with frontend expertise to break through this situation, so I was chosen. So the first work I did after joining was using <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gulp</a> and <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webpack</a> to create the frontend build process and integrate the bundled files with Django.</p>\n<p>But due to the business situation at the time, we couldn’t completely separate the frontend application from Django, so we had no choice but to apply a method where Django renders HTML once using its own template engine on the server, then Vue performs secondary rendering on the client.</p>\n<p>And searching “Django Vue” on Google in 2019 now shows several posts explaining how to use Django templates and Vue simultaneously, but when I was doing this work in May 2017, not a single such reference existed, so I had to design everything myself and come up with ideas to integrate them.</p>\n<p>I should have written a post about this work back then, but I’d just joined so I was too busy just understanding the entire codebase to think about posting.</p>\n<p>Ultimately this application is now called legacy by the current frontend chapter and became an application that nobody including me wants to touch - but honestly it was the best choice at that time so I don’t regret that decision. However, it was my first experience having code I wrote get called legacy by other developers over time, which was kind of interesting.</p>\n<p>This code had such a deformed structure difficult for typical frontend developers to understand that even while making it I thought “this will definitely be a problem later…?”</p>\n<p>Listing all the problems is hard, but representative issues were: multiple Vue instances existing, parts requiring Django knowledge to modify, and impossible complete migration from bower to npm since the existing code used bower packages. Of course, these issues are ongoing.</p>\n<p>These things pile up one by one to accumulate technical debt, so it had to be paid off someday. So I signed a 2-month freelance contract with my current company after resignation to migrate all frontend applications attached to this legacy application to a newly made frontend application project. <small>(Like cleaning up my own mess)</small></p>\n<h2 id=\"from-tech-supremacist-to-developer-who-sees-organizations\" style=\"position:relative;\">From Tech Supremacist to Developer Who Sees Organizations<a href=\"#from-tech-supremacist-to-developer-who-sees-organizations\" aria-label=\"from tech supremacist to developer who sees organizations permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I mentioned this once in a post called <a href=\"/2019/06/06/what-is-good-programmer/\">What Is a Good Developer?</a>, but when I first joined this company, my standard for a good developer was “a developer who develops requirements quickly and perfectly” and my development style was “makes things fast but has many small bugs.”</p>\n<p>So I tried to defend against my unreliable code through unit tests or design patterns that can reduce mistakes to supplement this weakness.</p>\n<p>But unlike my first job, here the CTO didn’t make all decisions - frontend developers made decisions about frontend applications. I had to do not just supplementing my weaknesses but also design and infrastructure that can flexibly respond to business, analyzing current application problems, and much more. Also, communicating outside the team was something I as a frontend developer had to do directly. <small>(Especially communicated a lot with the marketing team about SEO, user behavior data collection, etc.)</small></p>\n<p>Through this process, my conception of development expanded greatly - whereas before I mainly pondered “how can I develop better?”, after going through this process I pondered more “how can this application improve?” Going further, now I’m pondering not just applications but “how can this team work more efficiently?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-being-the-same-team-means\" style=\"position:relative;\">What Being the Same Team Means<a href=\"#what-being-the-same-team-means\" aria-label=\"what being the same team means permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Not long after I joined, the company received Series A investment, and the CEO’s promise then was “let’s go on a workshop abroad when we get investment!” So barely a month after joining I went on a workshop to Danang, Vietnam. <small>(Jackpot)</small></p>\n<p>It was about 3 nights 4 days I think, but the problem exploded the night before returning to Korea. A feature I’d developed before coming on the workshop wasn’t working at all in Internet Explorer. That feature had been deployed for about 3 weeks, and as users couldn’t use that feature in IE, the data flow chart started drawing strangely.</p>\n<p>Since not a single person in the company used IE at the time, we didn’t discover this problem early. But the biggest responsibility lay with me who developed that feature and didn’t properly test cross-browsing. So I immediately opened my MacBook and started hotfixing when I heard about it, but the time was already past midnight.</p>\n<p>The emotions I felt then were, um, self-blame for not testing properly and guilt for causing damage to the company through my carelessness. Anyway, I had to fix this quickly so I frantically analyzed and found the cause - the biggest problem was <code class=\"language-text\">Array.prototype.findIndex</code> method wasn’t properly transpiled by babel, plus several other minor issues. <small>(I haven’t trusted babel since)</small></p>\n<p>Fortunately I quickly found the bug cause, but the real problem was Vietnam’s internet was too slow, so building source and checking that feature’s operation took long, and since the problem area was a module handling API communication with the server, I had to test all core features using that module. Plus, the build process suddenly went haywire while fixing it and other problems cascaded, so fix time kept increasing.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/e67a8/vietnam_commit.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 48.12500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"vietnam commit\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/6af66/vietnam_commit.png\" srcset=\"/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/69538/vietnam_commit.png 160w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/72799/vietnam_commit.png 320w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/6af66/vietnam_commit.png 640w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/d9199/vietnam_commit.png 960w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/21b4d/vietnam_commit.png 1280w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/e67a8/vietnam_commit.png 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Nostalgic commits from that day</small>\n</center>\n<p>Ultimately various issues overlapped and the final release could only happen past 5am.

Of course, since this person’s major wasn’t this field and they had almost no experience doing product-related work, they were no different from a newcomer.</p>\n<p>Then as teams were divided into squad formations, this person and I came to work together in the same squad - when first working together I honestly didn’t pay much attention to them.

Though they had less experience than others, they were extremely passionate about making products, and also asked many questions - the quality of questions was quite good. Maybe that’s why, every time this person asked me development questions, I gradually taught with more enthusiasm, and this person always thanked me a lot for that.</p>\n<p>I also felt really good seeing that person grow quickly as I taught them knowledge I knew. I think I first thought then that knowledge I already knew and thought was nothing much could be tremendous help to others.</p>\n<p>And that person’s squad operation style was participatory where developers and designers all freely suggest ideas and they aggregate and organize them while proceeding - as that person’s experience and skills accumulated, synergy effects occurred so the team’s productivity increased and I remember the team’s morale and atmosphere being very good.

I suddenly started acting social.</p>\n<p>When I first joined, there was a backend developer who joined within a few days of me - for about a month after joining we barely talked besides work because I had no interest in people. <small>(This person was also shy so neither of us talked much)</small></p>\n<p>But now when someone new joins I talk to them first and drink or play games with other teams, acting social - thinking about it now, last year’s burnout was probably the catalyst.</p>\n<p>I experienced severe burnout around summer 2018 - until then I was someone who coded every single day of the year, 365 days. On weekdays I worked overtime until 11pm, came home and did toy projects until 2-3am, on weekends I did other toy projects with friends - that kind of period. I probably coded at least 7 hours every day all week like that.</p>\n<p>I’d lived this way continuously since 2014 when I returned to university after military discharge, so by 2018 when burnout came I’d lived like that for about 5 years. Then burnout suddenly hit - I just lost interest in coding itself and didn’t want to do anything.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/7f15f/contributions.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA3UlEQVR42iWPyW6EQAxE+f9fyyW3iTJZJMIEhrXbvUDTwIshlixL5SqXqzgOmJOQ1oWoc06elFZy3vGLZV6jttBJzRRrQjK6T/hrZuWtqgmkvLAfO0VKC0/7poIHrS0ZXMMoDeIcne2Z3MDka+7NK5/9i3IqxAu9GowilOM7xivPN2x7ojgdnnqglhuN3On9FxIMzkdc8EocaaWidZUa1DRjS4gJ682FP+wHo/tVzcRZxaLRfoylc4bBB/32jL1x7Ad50+h7Zs5Oo0b94B/fNm3Fz/gSe76nG2VfXrs/IVEyreqgrgEAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"contributions\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/6af66/contributions.png\" srcset=\"/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/69538/contributions.png 160w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/72799/contributions.png 320w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/6af66/contributions.png 640w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/d9199/contributions.png 960w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/21b4d/contributions.png 1280w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/7f15f/contributions.png 1530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>My sparse 2018 GitHub contributions</small>\n</center>\n<p>Even thinking about it now, it was an extremely bewildering emotion. Someone who coded 7-8 hours every day for 5 years because coding was so fun and enjoyable suddenly hating coding overnight is quite a strange feeling. I felt skepticism like “why do I need to struggle this hard?” and simultaneously felt anxiety like “am I falling behind?” I think I also thought “maybe development doesn’t suit me?”</p>\n<p>What I did wrong at this time was showing too obviously that I didn’t want to work. My inner thoughts then were “ah, it’s so boring and hard. Should I quit the company…?” so I distanced myself from team members and my work attitude was poor. During the day I worked half-heartedly and finished work by working overtime alone, so work didn’t pile up, but I couldn’t communicate much with team members.</p>\n<p>Hearing about it later, team members who’d worked with me long thought “this guy suddenly went weird…?” and approached me first, but other team members who didn’t know me well apparently thought I wasn’t working properly. So the team leader asked for tea time and we talked briefly - what that person said then still remains in my memory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Evan’s hardship isn’t Evan’s personal problem but the team’s problem. The team will help as much as possible.</p>\n<p>But you need to tell us what’s making it hard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hearing this, I wasn’t exactly moved but freshly thought again “right. We’re a team.” So from then I explained my current situation to people around me and could hear much advice - everyone around me said exactly the same thing: “rest a bit.”</p>\n<p>The life of working overtime daily, coding on weekends, having no hobbies and not dating made me exhausted. This fatigue tends to build up sneakily then explode bang! when passing some threshold, and now was exactly that timing. So everyone advised me to rest while doing other things besides coding.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/6a068/hwan.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 96.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"hwan\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/c08c5/hwan.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/0913d/hwan.jpg 160w,\n/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/cb69c/hwan.jpg 320w,\n/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/c08c5/hwan.jpg 640w,\n/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/6a068/hwan.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>People around me told me things like this regularly</small>\n</center>\n<p>So I lived a debauched life by my standards to relieve stress - drinking, playing pool, going to karaoke almost daily - and I could become close with people from teams besides the development team. When playing with the development team, we mostly talked about programming or organizational culture, somewhat work-related topics, but drinking with other teams I could hear new stories which was good.</p>\n<p>The experiences of hearing other teams’ stories became a foundation for me to understand and be more considerate of other teams’ situations when working at the company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stimulation-from-capable-team-members\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stimulation from Capable Team Members<a href=\"#stimulation-from-capable-team-members\" aria-label=\"stimulation from capable team members permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This is also subjective evaluation, but I think most teammates I worked with at this job over the past 2 years were self-directed in their work, made proactive decisions, and had good skills in their specialized fields. Of course, I’m not just talking about developers but including people from other teams.</p>\n<p>Of course, I received the most stimulation from developers working on the same team, and the teammate who stimulated me most was probably the same frontend developer. This person worked with me until yesterday - a senior frontend developer. This person isn’t the style who has tremendous passion for development and studies at home and such. But the ideas they casually toss out are so novel they can solve problems immediately.</p>\n<p>Of course, these ideas couldn’t come without deep understanding of JavaScript, and seeing this person solve in one shot a problem I’d pondered for a week just two days after joining made me think again “there really are many experts in the world.”</p>\n<p>It was a kind of timing issue where I couldn’t know when external SDK script loading finished, so the global variable holding that SDK was <code class=\"language-text\">null</code> during application initialization - I’d barely gotten it working with <code class=\"language-text\">setTimeout</code> and had no more ideas so left it alone. But this person saw this problem and immediately solved it by declaring an <code class=\"language-text\">isLoaded</code> variable as a <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> and resolving that promise when external SDK loading finished. <small>(Even now thinking about it, it’s a perverted but novel method.)</small></p>\n<p>And this person also solved the memory leak in the frontend render server I wrote with Express - I’d improved this problem several times so it was fine for now, but leaks themselves still occurred bit by bit. Meanwhile, when this senior updated external packages used in frontend, the memory leak suddenly accelerated. But I couldn’t identify this problem’s fundamental cause. So this person took this issue and decided to fix it, and I remember being quite surprised they solved the problem faster than expected.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/22475/leak_fix.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 37.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABHUlEQVR42p2P3U7CQBCF+/5voAmGGBPDhRcmvoHRRMXQQC2KUNpSaIF2oWjLT2k/h4YYrxSc5GRPZs5+u6P50YKpEoUx2XLFsZVlmdwN2SRzEuWjFduM7TQie+1itXoky43ECoriMOV5XmrHId8KUF748Mbc3LWpNZ1vYF4cDt1V6eUsgZblc6Lb1NoenyWQo4A/pd27EdXWgOqLy6UxIE7/Bv4202rvY87MIeemy4XhMkvW+xX4V2lX1oSK6VExHE51h26UEK82zOSnStYP0zXBYslQ1FMJ5mRBw48xxguceYotvb5KiSQ/k7x22/G5fnJ4dkOaXkC952GOIjqBoiG+YQe0Roq67fPYH6EPQ3SZP4jf9Zr+fibZt0DxBSoiZHLOHyBEAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"leak fix\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/6af66/leak_fix.png\" srcset=\"/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/69538/leak_fix.png 160w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/72799/leak_fix.png 320w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/6af66/leak_fix.png 640w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/d9199/leak_fix.png 960w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/22475/leak_fix.png 1039w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Dramatic change in transaction time</small>\n</center>\n<p>It was a leak occurring when some external packages designed to only be usable on the client were used during server-side rendering timing - I hadn’t even thought of this case as a possibility.</p>\n<p>Besides that, I was also positively influenced a lot by a backend developer I worked with long regarding design and perspectives on business, and learned passion for products from a mobile developer who likes working overtime.

CTO가 기존 Django로만 작성된 프로젝트를 운영하다가 프론트엔드 프레임워크의 필요성을 느끼고 React를 도입하려다가 한번 실패하고 차선책으로 Vue를 어떻게든 돌아가게만 적용해놓은 상황이었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 당시 CTO는 백엔드 개발자였기 때문에 프론트엔드에 전문성을 가진 누군가가 이 상황을 타개해줬으면 했던 것이고 그래서 필자가 간택당한 것이다. 그래서 필자가 입사한 다음 했던 첫 작업이 바로 <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gulp</a>와 <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webpack</a>을 사용해서 프론트엔드 빌드 프로세스를 만들고, 번들링되어 나온 파일들을 Django와 연동시키는 그런 작업이었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 당시 비즈니스 상황 상 프론트엔드 어플리케이션을 Django로부터 완전 분리해서 작성할 수가 없었기에 Django가 서버에서 자체 템플릿 엔진을 사용하여 한번 HTML을 렌더하고 클라이언트에서 Vue가 2차 렌더링을 진행하는 방식으로 적용할 수 밖에 없었다.</p>\n<p>그리고 2019년 현재 구글에 “Django Vue”라고 검색해보면 Django 템플릿과 Vue를 동시에 사용할 수 있는 방법을 설명한 몇 개의 포스팅이 나오지만 필자가 이 작업을 진행했던 2017년 5월에는 그런 레퍼런스가 단 한개도 존재하지 않았기 때문에 모든 것을 필자 스스로 설계하고 아이디어를 짜내서 연동해야했다.</p>\n<p>당시에 이 작업으로 포스팅을 작성했으면 좋았을 것 같은데 입사한지 얼마 되지 않았을 때라 포스팅이고 나발이고 일단 전체 코드를 파악하는 것만 해도 정신이 없었다.</p>\n<p>결국 이 어플리케이션은 현재 프론트엔드 챕터에게 레거시라고 불리며 필자를 포함한 그 누구도 건드리기 싫어하는 어플리케이션이 되었는데, 뭐 사실 그때 당시에는 그게 최선이긴 했기 때문에 당시 결정에 후회는 없다. 하지만 필자가 작성한 코드가 시간이 지나서 다른 개발자들에게 레거시라고 불리게 되는 경험은 처음이었기에 나름 흥미로웠다.</p>\n<p>이 코드는 사실 그 당시 필자가 만들면서도 “이거 나중에 분명히 문제될 것 같은데…?”라고 생각할 정도로 일반적인 프론트엔드들이 이해하기 힘든 기형적인 구조였다.</p>\n<p>문제가 많아서 일일히 나열하기는 힘들지만 대표적인 이슈는 바로 여러 개의 Vue 인스턴스가 존재한다는 것과 DJango를 할 줄 알아야 수정이 가능한 부분이 있다는 것, 그리고 기존 코드에서 bower 패키지를 사용하고 있었기 때문에 bower를 걷어내고 npm으로 완전히 갈아타는 것이 불가능하다는 것이었다. 물론 이 이슈는 현재진행형이다.</p>\n<p>이런 것들이 하나하나 쌓여서 결국 기술 부채가 누적되는 것이기 때문에 언젠가 청산을 하긴 해야 했다. 그래서 필자는 퇴사 후 현 직장과 2개월 프리랜서 계약을 체결하고 이 레거시 어플리케이션에 붙어있는 프론트엔드 어플리케이션을 전부 새로 만든 프론트엔드 어플리케이션 프로젝트로 마이그레이션하는 작업을 진행하기로 하였다.

스타일”이었다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 당시 이 단점을 보완하기 위해 유닛 테스트나 실수를 줄일 수 있는 설계 패턴 등을 통해서 신뢰성이 떨어지는 필자 코드에 대한 방어선을 펼치는 방향으로 노력을 했었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 필자의 첫 직장과 다르게 여기서는 CTO가 모든 의사결정을 하지 않고 프론트엔드 어플리케이션에 대한 의사결정은 프론트엔드 개발자가 하는 구조였다. 단순히 필자의 단점을 보완하는 것 뿐만 아니라 비즈니스에 유연하게 대응할 수 있는 설계와 인프라, 현재 어플리케이션이 가지고 있는 문제점의 분석 등 많은 것을 함께 해야했던 것이다. 또한 팀 외부와 소통하는 것 또한 필자가 프론트엔드 개발자로써 직접 해야했다. <small>(특히 마케팅팀과 SEO, 유저 행동 데이터 수집 등에 대해 많은 커뮤니케이션을 했었다)</small></p>\n<p>이 과정에서 필자가 생각하고 있던 개발의 영역이 많이 확장되게 되었는데, 기존에는 “내가 어떻게 하면 더 개발을 잘할 수 있을까?”를 위주로 고민했다면 이 과정을 겪고 나서는 “이 어플리케이션이 어떻게 하면 더 발전할 수 있을까?”를 더 고민하게 되었다. 더 나아가서 지금은 어플리케이션 뿐만 아니라 “이 팀이 어떻게 하면 더 효율적으로 일할 수 있을까?”까지 고민하고 있는 상황이다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"같은-팀이라는-것\" style=\"position:relative;\">같은 팀이라는 것<a href=\"#%EA%B0%99%EC%9D%80-%ED%8C%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%9D%BC%EB%8A%94-%EA%B2%83\"

Series A 투자를 받게 되었는데, 그때 CEO가 했던 약속이 “우리 투자받으면 해외로 한번 워크샵가자!”였었다. 그래서 필자는 입사한지 거의 한달만에 베트남 다낭으로 워크샵을 떠나게 되었다. <small>(개꿀)</small></p>\n<p>대략 3박 4일 정도였던 것 같은데 문제는 한국으로 귀국하기 바로 전날 밤에 터졌다. 필자가 워크샵을 오기 전에 개발했던 기능이 있었는데 이 기능이 Internet Explorer에서 아예 작동하지않고 있었던 것이다. 그 기능이 배포된 지는 대략 3주 정도 되었고, 유저들이 IE에서 해당 기능을 사용하지 못하자 데이터 플로우 차트가 이상하게 그려지기 시작했던 것이다.</p>\n<p>당시 사내에 IE를 사용하는 사람이 단 한명도 없었기에 이 문제를 조기에 발견하지 못했다. 하지만 제일 큰 책임은 해당 기능을 개발하고 제대로 크로스 브라우징을 테스트하지않았던 필자에게 있었다. 그래서 필자는 그 이야기를 듣자마자 바로 맥북을 펴고 핫픽스를 하기 시작했는데 그때 시간은 이미 00시를 넘기고 있었다.</p>\n<p>그때 들었던 감정은 음, 테스트를 제대로 하지 않았다는 자책감과 나의 부주의함으로 인해 회사에 피해를 끼쳤다는 미안함이었던 것 같다. 어쨌든 이걸 빨리 고쳐야하니 정신없이 분석하면서 원인을 찾게 되었는데, 제일 큰 문제는 바로 <code class=\"language-text\">Array.prototype.findIndex</code> 메소드를 babel이 제대로 트랜스파일링 해주지 않았던 것이었고 그 외 자잘한 이슈도 몇개 더 있었다.<small>(필자는 이 이후로 babel을 안 믿는다)</small></p>\n<p>다행히 빠르게 버그 원인을 알아냈지만 진짜 문제는 베트남 인터넷이 너무 느려서 소스를 빌드하고 해당 기능의 작동을 확인하는 것도 오래 걸리고 문제가 발생한 부분이 서버와의 API 통신을 담당하는 모듈이라서 해당 모듈을 사용하는 핵심 기능을 전부 테스트해야 했었다. 게다가 그걸 고치는 과정에서 빌드 프로세스도 갑자기 맛이 가는 등 연쇄적으로 문제가 커져서 픽스 시간은 점점 늘어났다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:

분의 전공은 이 쪽 분야가 아니기도 하고 프로덕트와 관련된 일을 해본 경험도 거의 없었기 때문에 신입과 다름 없는 상태였다.</p>\n<p>그러다가 팀을 스쿼드 편제로 나누게 되면서 이 분과 필자는 같은 스쿼드에서 함께 일을 하게 되었는데, 처음 같이 일을 할때는 사실 별로 이 분에 대해서 신경을 안썼다. 뭐 알아서 잘하시겠지… 혹여나 못하더라도 나나 누군가가 커버할 수 있겠지 정도?</p>\n<p>하지만 같이 일을 하게 되면서 그 전까지는 몰랐던 이 분의 새로운 모습들을 많이 보게 되었다. 비록 남들보다 경험은 적을지라도 굉장히 프로덕트를 만든다는 일에 열정적이었고, 또 질문도 굉장히 많이 하시는 편이었는데 질문의 질이 굉장히 좋았다. 그래서였는지 이 분이 필자에게 개발에 대한 질문을 할 때마다 필자도 점점 열의를 가지고 가르쳐드리게 되었는데, 이 분은 항상 그 점에 있어서 필자에게 고맙다는 이야기를 많이 해줬었다.</p>\n<p>필자 또한 필자가 알고 있는 지식을 그 분에게 알려드리면서 실제로 그 분이 빠르게 성장하는 모습을 보고 나니 필자도 기분이 굉장히 좋았다. 내가 이미 알고 있는 별 것 아니라고 생각했던 지식이 다른 사람에게는 굉장한 도움이 될 수 있다는 생각을 이때 처음으로 하게 되었던 것 같다.</p>\n<p>그리고 그 분의 스쿼드 운영 스타일은 개발자와 디자이너들이 모두 자유롭게 아이디어를 내고 본인이 그걸 취합하고 정리하면서 진행하는 참여형이었는데 그 분의 경험과 실력이 점점 쌓이면서 시너지 효과가 발생해서 팀의 생산성도 높아지고 팀의 사기와 분위기도 많이 좋았던 기억이 난다. 결국 필자가 그 분에게 개발에 대한 지식을 알려줬던 그 행동이 필자와 그 분뿐만 아니라 팀 전체에 영향을 주었던 것이다.</p>\n<p>그런 과정을 겪으면서 필자는 “개인이 각자 잘하면 팀은 알아서 잘 굴러간다”와 같은 생각에 더 이상 동의하지 않게 되었다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"아싸에서-나름-인싸로\" style=\"position:relative;\">아싸에서

필자와 며칠 차이로 입사했던 백엔드 개발자분이 계셨는데, 이 분과는 입사하고 거의 한달 정도는 업무 이야기 외에 별로 말을 안할 정도로 사람한테 관심이 없었다. <small>(이 분도 낯가리는 성격이라 둘 다 말을 잘 안걸었다)</small></p>\n<p>근데 지금은 어떤 분이 새로 입사하면 먼저 말도 걸기도 하고 다른 팀과 같이 술을 마시거나 게임도 하러가는 등 인싸같은 행동을 많이 하게 되었는데, 지금 생각해보면 아마도 작년의 번아웃이 뭔가 계기가 되었던 것 같다.</p>\n<p>필자는 2018년 여름 쯤에 한번 번아웃을 크게 겪은 적이 있었는데, 그 전까지 필자는 1년 365일 매일 코딩만 하는 사람이었다. 평일에는 밤 11시까지 야근하고 집에 와서 새벽 2-3시까지 토이 프로젝트를 하고, 주말에는 친구들과 또 다른 토이 프로젝트를 진행하고는 했던 그런 시기였다. 그렇게 일주일 내내 하루에 무조건 코딩을 7시간 씩은 했던 것 같다.</p>\n<p>필자는 이 생활을 군대 전역 후 대학교에 복학했던 2014년부터 계속 해왔으니 번아웃이 왔던 2018년에는 대략 5년 정도 그렇게 살아왔던 셈이다. 그러다가 갑자기 번아웃이 찾아왔는데, 그때는 그냥 코딩 자체에 흥미가 떨어져서 아무것도 하기 싫었다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a

잔디</small>\n</center>\n<p>지금 생각해봐도 굉장히 당혹스러운 감정이었다. 코딩이 그렇게 즐겁고 재밌어서 5년 내내 매일 7-8시간씩 코딩을 했던 사람이었는데 하루 아침에 갑자기 코딩이 싫어지게 되는 기분이란 꽤나 이상한 감정이다. “내가 왜 이렇게까지 아둥바둥해야하지?”라는 회의감도 들었고 “이러다가 뒤쳐지는 거 아니야?”라는 불안함도 동시에 들었다. “개발이 나랑 맞지 않나?”라는 생각도 들었던 것 같다.</p>\n<p>이 당시 필자가 잘못 했던 것은 바로 일하기 싫은 티를 너무 팍팍 내고 다닌 것이었다. 이 당시 필자의 속마음은 “아 너무 재미없고 힘들다. 회사 그만 둘까…?”였기 때문에 팀원들과도 거리를 두고 업무 태도도 불량했다. 낮에는 업무를 설렁설렁하고 혼자 야근하면서 일을 끝내는 경우가 많았기 때문에 일이 밀리거나 하지는 않았지만 팀원들과 커뮤니케이션을 많이 못했었다.</p>\n<p>나중에 들어보니 당시 필자와 함께 오래 일했던 팀원들은 “얘 갑자기 뭔가 맛이 갔는데…?”라는 생각을 하고 필자에게 먼저 다가와 주었지만, 필자를 잘 몰랐던 다른 팀 분들은 업무를 제대로 하지 않는다고 생각하기도 했다고 한다. 그래서 당시 팀 리더가 필자에게 티타임을 신청하고 잠깐 이야기를 나눴었는데, 그때 그 분이 했던 말이 아직도 기억에 남는다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>에반이 힘든 건 에반 개인의 문제가 아니라 팀의 문제에요. 팀이 도와줄 수 있는 건 최대한 도와줄게요.</p>\n<p>대신 뭐 때문에 힘든지는 이야기 해줘야해요.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>이 이야기를 듣고 솔직히 감동까지는 아니였지만 “맞네. 우리는 팀이었지.”라는 생각이 새삼스럽게 다시 들었었다. 그래서 이때부터 필자는 주변에 계신 분들께 필자의 현재 상황을 설명하고 많은 조언을 들을 수 있었는데, 주변에 계신 분들이 전부 똑같이 이야기한 것이 바로 “좀 쉬어라”였다.</p>\n<p>매일 야근하고 주말에도 코딩하고 취미도 없고 연애도 하지 않는 생활이 필자를 지치게 만들었다는 것이다. 이런 피로감은 어느 순간 슬금슬금 생기다가 어떤 임계점을 넘어가는 순간 빵! 터지게 되는 경우가 많고, 지금이 바로 그 타이밍이라고 했다. 그래서 다들 코딩말고 좀 다른 것도 해보면서 쉬라는 조언을 많이 해주셨었다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span

의사결정과 전문분야에 대한 스킬도 좋았던 것 같다. 물론 개발자만 이야기하는 것이 아니라 다른 팀에 있는 분들도 포함하는 이야기이다.</p>\n<p>물론 가장 큰 자극은 같은 팀에서 일하는 개발자들로부터 많이 받게 되었는데, 가장 많은 자극을 받았던 팀원은 아무래도 같은 프론트엔드 개발자가 아닐까 싶다. 이 분은 바로 어제까지 필자와 함께 일했던 시니어 프론트엔드 개발자이다. 이 분은 사실 개발에 엄청난 열정을 가지고 집에서도 공부하고 그런 스타일은 아니다. 하지만 아무렇지 않게 툭툭 던지는 아이디어가 문제를 바로 해결할 수 있을 정도로 신박한 것들이 많았다.</p>\n<p>물론 이 아이디어들은 자바스크립트에 대한 깊은 이해가 없이는 나올 수 없는 것들이었고, 이 분이 입사한지 이틀만에 필자가 일주일 동안 고민했던 문제를 단박에 풀어버리는 것을 보고 “역시 세상엔 굇수가 많군”이라는 생각이 다시 들었던 것 같다.</p>\n<p>외부 SDK 스크립트 로드가 끝나는 시점을 알 수가 없어서 어플리케이션 초기화 시 해당 SDK가 담기는 전역 변수가 <code class=\"language-text\">null</code>인 일종의 타이밍 이슈였는데, 필자는 이걸 <code class=\"language-text\">setTimeout</code>으로 간신히 작동하게만 만들어 놓고 더 이상 아이디어가 없어서 방치하고 있던 상황이었다. 근데 이 분이 이 문제를 보자마자 <code class=\"language-text\">isLoaded</code> 변수를 <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code>로 선언하고 외부 SDK 로드가 끝나면 해당 프로미스를 <code class=\"language-text\">resolve</code>하는 방식으로 해결했다. <small>(지금 생각해도 변태같지만 신박한 방법이다.)</small></p>\n<p>그리고 필자가 Express로 작성한 프론트엔드 렌더 서버에 있던 메모리 릭도 이 분이 해결했었는데, 이 문제는 필자가 몇번 개선은 해서 당장은 문제가 없었지만 누수 자체는 그래도 조금씩 발생하고 있었다. 그런 와중에 이 시니어분이 프론트엔드에서 사용하고 있는 외부 패키지들을 최신화했는데 갑자기 메모리 릭이 가속화된 상황이었다. 하지만 필자는 이 문제의 근본적인 원인이 무엇인지 파악하지 못하고 있는 상태였다. 그래서 이 분이 이 이슈를 가져가서 고치기로 했는데, 예상보다 빠른 시간 안에 문제를 해결해서 꽤나 놀랬던 기억이 난다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;

것을 배울 수 있었던 기회였다. 개발자가 아닌 분들에게서는 개발을 넘어선 다른 분야의 지식도 함께 배울 수 있었다. 필자에게 여러분은 어떤 때에는 프로페셔널한 팀원이었고 어떤 때에는 같이 일하는 친구같은 느낌이었다. 비록 회사를 떠나며 함께 일할 수 없게 되었지만 다른 곳에서 또 만날 수 있게 되기를 바란다.</p>\n<p>2년 동안 좋은 추억을 만들어준
