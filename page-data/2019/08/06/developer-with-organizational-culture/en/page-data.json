That’s why we need constant attention to whether this organization is healthy, whether we’re working with energy and productivity.</p>\n<p>But I’ve often seen most developers pay lots of attention to technology or development culture while showing little interest in organizational culture.

It’s important. But I’m so swamped with issues right now…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the senior developers who gave me these responses were genuinely busy at work. But the fact they could say this means organizational culture had fallen in their personal priorities - relatively speaking, the importance of organizational culture hadn’t really hit home for them.</p>\n<p>So in this post I want to talk about why we as team members should care about organizational culture, and what we can do for organizational culture starting tomorrow. Of course, the CEO as organizational leader plays the most important role in forming good organizational culture, but I’ve never been a CEO and don’t particularly want to be one in the future - I’d rather just code - so I’ll only unpack this story from a team member’s perspective.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-developers-really-need-to-care-about-organizational-culture\" style=\"position:relative;\">Do Developers Really Need to Care About Organizational Culture?<a href=\"#do-developers-really-need-to-care-about-organizational-culture\" aria-label=\"do developers really need to care about organizational culture permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Some of you are probably thinking this. Do developers really need to care about organizational culture? Shouldn’t culture staff or the CEO care about and lead organizational culture improvements?</p>\n<p>Actually yes. Establishing proper organizational culture is a key goal of culture teams, or sometimes HR teams handle it if there’s no culture team. And it’s true that if the CEO doesn’t care about improving organizational culture, no amount of employee demands will improve it. So we can ask again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So organizational culture isn’t my responsibility… shouldn’t I focus on being good at programming as a developer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, that’s also true. As a developer you should obviously be good at programming. Actually I think having the desire to be good at programming matters more than being good itself. This is a basic desire and professional responsibility for people with the developer occupation.</p>\n<p>It sounds cold but it’s obvious - imagine an Overwatch pro gamer in bronze tier. Right there you’d think “Wait, bronze?” Plus if this person stayed in the depths for 5 years, something’s wrong.</p>\n<p>But anyway, for people who make a living programming, being good at programming is ultimately a passive skill. Good developers need to think beyond programming. Because we’re ultimately people working between computers and humans, we can’t be free from the world outside computers.</p>\n<p>In that world outside computers are teammates I work with, beyond them our whole team, and beyond that our company. I’ll emphasize again - we’re absolutely not people who only work with computers. Even if you’re a digital nomad traveling the world working remotely, you’ll constantly need to log into Skype at dawn to match Korean work hours.</p>\n<p>Ultimately we can’t help being affected by our organization, and good organizational culture ultimately affects individual team members’ happiness, work fulfillment, and vision. This is why I think developers should also care about organizational culture.</p>\n<p>Caring about organizational culture naturally includes thinking about good organizational culture. Good organizational culture usually doesn’t just pop up overnight, so it takes combined effort from team members like us and leaders like CEOs to barely take root in an organization.</p>\n<p>So what actions can we take for organizational culture - for our team - starting tomorrow?</p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-be-happy-first\" style=\"position:relative;\">Let’s Be Happy First<a href=\"#lets-be-happy-first\" aria-label=\"lets be happy first permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I’m someone who thinks “if individuals are happy, the organization is happy.” If your morning commute feels like hell every day and you just stare blankly coding at boring work in the office, is that organization healthy? I’d say probably not. Plus these problems don’t show outwardly due to what’s commonly called social life.</p>\n<p>Actually my saying “if individuals are happy, the organization is happy” isn’t some pie-in-the-sky talk. Research results already show that people with positive emotions like happiness have better work efficiency, focus, and ability development. This individual development inevitably positively affects the organization too.</p>\n<p>A somewhat well-known concept in this field is psychological capital, a concept created by management scholar Fred Luthans in 2000. This concept already has many papers and active ongoing research, so I recommend Googling it.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/8454b/googled.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 87.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"googled\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/6af66/googled.png\" srcset=\"/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/69538/googled.png 160w,\n/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/72799/googled.png 320w,\n/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/6af66/googled.png 640w,\n/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/d9199/googled.png 960w,\n/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/21b4d/googled.png 1280w,\n/static/a06d0f2a9dcbf57e6a25a15daca59fa4/8454b/googled.png 1798w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Searching \"psychological capital\" on Google shows many academic materials</small>\n</center>\n<p>So how can individuals become happy within organizations?

Small actions by individual team members can naturally create an implicit organizational atmosphere.

Almost 10 years ago so I definitely look younger. Jealous...</small>\n</center>\n<p>Hip-hop strongly emphasizes the spirit of Respect, which literally means respecting each other. B-boys provoke and battle each other with various gestures and dance, but underneath lies the spirit of thinking of opponents as fellow b-boys.</p>\n<p>When I was in high school, there was a famous practice studio called Munrae YMCA where everyone from neighborhood rookie b-boys to top pro teams came to practice. I practiced breakdancing there every weekend and could hear lots of advice from older guys. Back then I happened to get advice from a world-famous b-boy - I don’t remember the exact context but I still clearly remember one thing he said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If someone’s doing b-boying, whether they started one day ago or ten years ago, we’re all b-boys. So get in the habit of Respecting others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This saying actually greatly influenced my value formation. And I’ve always applied this Respect spirit the same way whether doing b-boying, music, or programming. If someone has a programming occupation or is currently studying programming, that fact alone means I should respect them as a developer.</p>\n<p>If you hold this spirit and talk with other developers, their career no longer matters. Whether a new developer who joined yesterday or a senior developer who’s been around over 10 years - we’re equal before the fact that “we’re developers.” Of course seniors have more accumulated experience so they might program better than juniors. But don’t forget that purely in terms of technical skill, there are many juniors better than seniors. Don’t look down on someone simply because they have less experience or are younger.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when talking, someone might say something logically wrong, but don’t sneer “you don’t even know this?” - have the mature mind to give proper feedback on what’s wrong. And if someone gives you feedback, even if they’re a 14-year-old developer who just graduated elementary school, have the mindset to ponder that feedback.</p>\n<p>If you can make a living programming, whether junior or senior, a developer is a developer. So always have respect for colleagues you work with. If colleagues feel their abilities are respected within the team, that respect will eventually come back to you. Individual happiness can’t exist in teams that don’t respect each other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"find-your-happiness-within-the-organization\" style=\"position:relative;\">Find Your Happiness Within the Organization<a href=\"#find-your-happiness-within-the-organization\" aria-label=\"find your happiness within the organization permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>You might think this is typical self-help book talk these days, but as I explained above, it’s not wrong so you can’t just skip it. And the happiness I’m talking about isn’t as grand a concept as you might think.</p>\n<p>Actually I’m quite far from the “Ah, I’m happy~” emotion. Not that I’m unhappy - I just rarely ask myself questions like “am I happy right now?” so I don’t think “I’m happy now!” either.</p>\n<p>So the happiness I’m talking about can be seen as simply not being unhappy. It might be developer-like binary thinking, but since happiness depends on your mindset, I guess I am happy.</p>\n<p>But the happiness we generally think of is… like the happiness when your salary increases 20%. <small>(Can’t quite express it in words)</small> But this kind of happiness is like a hamster wheel - even if my salary went up 20%, I’ll soon be seeking the next level of happiness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh my salary became 40 million won! But they take so much tax…? I wish I could make 4 million won a month…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course the emotion from a salary increase can be happiness, but the happiness I’m talking about isn’t that kind. It’s more modest - like I just said, the small happiness of “I’m not particularly unhappy, right? So I guess I’m kinda happy?”</p>\n<p>And this happiness standard differs so much between people that it’s hard to pinpoint. For some people the happiness standard might absolutely be money, while others might be happy just smelling fresh wind on their morning commute.</p>\n<p>So let me talk based on my own standard. My standard might not make sense to some, but just accept it as “this kind of person exists too.”</p>\n<p>First, I have a very straightforward personality. If I think no, I say no; if I think yes, I say yes. At work, in a meeting with nearly 50 people, I once spent almost an hour criticizing how our current data-driven decisions weren’t truly for our users but purely for our metrics, pointing out one by one what our company was doing wrong.</p>\n<p>Some people thanked me for speaking their minds seeing such behavior, but others worried I was too straightforward. <small>(Along with saying other companies are even worse…)</small></p>\n<p>Of course I know this personality might look bad by social norms, and I could live quietly fitting into society. I hid my straightforward personality in the military and was a faithful soldier who did what he was told, so I could do that again if asked.</p>\n<p>And honestly, criticizing the whole company alone in front of all employees including the CEO isn’t easy. In such situations most people would get nervous and think “what if I’m wrong?” So after deciding to say this, I searched everything from papers to academic materials to case studies until 2-3am almost daily.</p>\n<p>But the reason I could ultimately act like this despite these obstacles was because my happiness standard as an organization member is making something that can help people. That’s why when criticizing data-driven decisions, I could state my opinion in front of many people:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t want to make products to increase metrics like conversion rates or revenue - I want to make products where people can have good experiences through our service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And after speaking out like that, many people agreed so the company ultimately changed in a good direction. Though I’m still wondering if I did the right thing…</p>\n<p>Anyway through this process I could ultimately empathize with “how does making this product help users” while developing products, and was satisfied with the result. Methods of finding your own happiness within organizations range from such active methods to cautious methods - I hope everyone spends time at home after work pondering “what’s my happiness standard?”</p>\n<h3 id=\"dont-obsess-over-what-you-cant-control\" style=\"position:relative;\">Don’t Obsess Over What You Can’t Control<a href=\"#dont-obsess-over-what-you-cant-control\" aria-label=\"dont obsess over what you cant control permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>This is a bit monk-like talk so some might not relate, but from my experience, the best example fitting this content is money.</p>\n<p>Until 2017 I was extremely sensitive about money. How much? I lived on 300,000 won a month. Transportation, cigarettes, meals all combined - 300,000 won. I lived like that as a college student and it stuck as habit after becoming a working adult. Inside this was the desire “I need to quickly save money and buy a house at least.” Well, everyone my age thinks this so it’s not particularly special thinking.</p>\n<p>But I went a bit overboard - living on only 300,000 won a month makes it honestly hard to buy clothes, get haircuts, or have drinks with friends. And crucially, money doesn’t pile up just because you want to save it. Even saving and saving 300,000 won monthly, I was barely approaching my goal.</p>\n<p>So one day I suddenly felt skeptical about living just to save money, got a bit tired and stayed in a lethargic state, so I had tea time with my workplace CTO back then and talked about “I don’t know if I’m living right.”</p>\n<p>But actually my mind was already made up. I just wanted to hear “stop whining and save harder!” But I got an unexpected answer from that guy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A guy destined to drive a Matiz can at most drive a Sonata no matter how hard he tries. He’ll never drive a Benz.<br />\nSimilarly, no matter how hard Evan saves money, unless you get lucky with something, the difference is just a 2-room place becoming a 3-room place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These words could sound quite cold, but I think I felt a lot back then. I started pondering things like “will I be happy if two rooms become three?” After long pondering, just one extra room probably wouldn’t occupy such a big portion of my life, so I concluded “let’s just live as it comes.” <small>(And I seriously started stocks…)</small></p>\n<p>Of course, the same goes for salary I mentioned above. You might feel good if your salary increases. But that good feeling is brief. Human hearts are so fickle that even if my salary went up 20%, after about 6 months I’ll want another 20% increase. But unless you switch jobs through good opportunity, that’s impossible.</p>\n<p>Plus, when salary goes from 20 million to 30 million won the increase feels big, but going from 30 to 40, 40 to 50, they take progressively more tax so actual take-home pay doesn’t differ that much.</p>\n<p>I’m saying this because money isn’t something that goes my way. If everyone wanting to make lots of money could make lots of money, the world would only have rich people. Getting salary increases, getting new income like book writing - these need some luck. You can’t compete 100% on skill.</p>\n<p>So after this thinking I’m living fairly happily with the mindset “just code hard. Money will follow someday.” Obsessing over money I can’t control feels somehow similar to unrequited love - quite painful. Just pour spare money into large caps like Google or Nvidia and leave it to heaven.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As I’ve said several times, forming good organizational culture absolutely requires the CEO as organizational leader’s attention. But many CEOs still don’t care about organizational culture, and even if they care, it often falls in priority, so realistically expecting “the company will create good organizational culture on its own” seems a bit much.</p>\n<p>But as explained above, there are things we can do right now for the team, for the organization. Saying “let’s be happy first” might sound like “let’s only make myself happy,” but as I said at the start, my individual happiness can ultimately become our team’s happiness and further form implicitly happy organizational culture.</p>\n<p>Actually the content I discussed is subjective based on my experience, so you might not relate. But what I wanted to say through this post isn’t “be happy like me” but that there are small things you can do for organizational culture right now.</p>\n<p>We’re salaried developers working for pay, but we’re ultimately members of some organization, and I think there are many things we can do for that organization besides programming. And if we care about organizational culture and have the will to improve it, making small efforts, maybe in 10 years newly hired developers might work in environments more fun, happy, and constructive than ours?</p>\n<p>That’s all for this post on why developers should care about organizational culture.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190806-developer-with-organizational-culture-en","path":"/2019/08/06/developer-with-organizational-culture/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Developers

없다면 HR팀이 담당하는 경우도 있다. 그리고 CEO가 조직문화의 개선에 관심이 없으면 아무리 직원들이 조직문화의 개선을 외쳐도 개선이 되지 않는 것도 맞다. 그렇다면 다시 이런 질문을 던져볼 수 있겠다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>그럼 조직문화는 내 담당도 아니고… 나는 개발자니까 프로그래밍을 잘하는 것에 집중해야 하지 않을까?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>음, 그 말도 맞다. 개발자로써 당연히 프로그래밍을 잘하면 좋다. 사실 프로그래밍을 잘한다는 사실 자체 보다는 프로그래밍을 잘하고 싶은 욕구가 있어야하는 것이 더 중요하다고 생각한다. 이건 개발자라는 직업을 가진 사람으로써 기본적인 욕구이자 직업적인 책임이다.</p>\n<p>냉정해보이지만 사실 당연한 개념인데, 어떤 사람이 오버워치 프로게이머인데 티어가 브론즈라고 생각해보자. 여기서부터 벌써 “응? 브론즈?”라는 생각이 들 것이다. 게다가 이 사람이 5년 동안 심해에만 머물러 있다면 이건 뭔가 잘못된 거다.</p>\n<p>하지만 어쨌든 프로그램으로 먹고 사는 사람에게 프로그래밍을 잘한다는 것은 결국 패시브 스킬 같은 것이다. 좋은 개발자는 프로그래밍을 넘어선 부분도 생각해야한다. 결국 우리는 컴퓨터와 사람 사이에서 일하는 사람들이기 때문에 컴퓨터 바깥의 세상으로부터 자유롭지 못하기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>그 컴퓨터 바깥의 세상에는 나와 함께 일하는 팀원이 있고, 그 너머에는 우리 팀 전체, 또 그 너머에는 우리 회사가 있다. 다시 강조해서 말하지만 우리는 절대 컴퓨터랑만 일하는 사람들이 아니라는 점을 명심하자. 심지어 여러분이 세계 곳곳을 여행하며 원격 근무하는 디지털 노마드라고 하더라도 한국의 업무 시간에 맞춰서 새벽에 스카이프에 접속해야하는 일은 비일비재할 것이다.</p>\n<p>결국 우리는 어쩔 수 없이 조직에 영향을 받을 수 밖에 없고, 좋은 조직문화는 결국 조직원 개개인의 행복이나 업무의 성취감, 비전에도 영향을 끼친다. 이것이 필자가 생각하는 개발자도 조직문화에 관심을 가져야하는 이유이다.</p>\n<p>조직문화에 관심을 가진다는 것은 당연히 좋은 조직문화에 대해서 고민한다는 것도 포함한다. 좋은 조직문화는 보통 하루아침에 뚝딱 만들어지는 것이 아니기 때문에 우리 같은 팀원들과 CEO같은 리더들의 노력이 함께 어우러져야 겨우겨우 조직에 자리잡을 수 있다.</p>\n<p>그렇다면 우리가 당장 내일부터 조직문화를 위해, 즉 우리 팀을 위해 할 수 있는 행동은 어떤 것이 있을까?</p>\n<h2 id=\"우리부터-먼저-행복해지자\" style=\"position:relative;\">우리부터 먼저 행복해지자<a

<small>오른쪽에 브이하고 있는 게 필자. 거의 10년 전이니 확실히 어려보인다. 부럽...</small>\n</center>\n<p>힙합은 Respect라는 정신을 굉장히 강조하는 데 이는 말 그대로 서로를 존중하는 것을 의미한다. 비보이들이 배틀에서 각종 제스쳐와 춤으로 상대를 서로 도발하고 싸우긴 하지만 그 이면에는 상대방을 나와 같은 비보이로 생각한다는 정신이 깔려있는 것이다.</p>\n<p>필자가 고등학생 때에는 찔랭이 동네 비보이부터 날고 기는 프로 팀까지 모두 연습을 하러 오는 유명한 연습실인 문래YMCA란 곳이 있었는데, 필자도 주말마다 여기서 비보잉 연습을 하면서 많은 형들의 조언을 들을 수 있었다. 이 당시 필자는 세계적으로 유명했던 한 비보이로부터 우연히 조언을 들은 적이 있었는데, 정확한 문맥은 기억안나지만 그 분의 말 한마디는 아직도 똑똑히 기억난다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>누군가 비보잉을 하고 있다면, 그 사람이 춤을 시작한지 하루가 되었든 10년이 되었든 우리는 다 같은 비보이다. 그러니까 상대방을 Respect하는 습관을 들여라.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>이 말은 사실 필자의 가치관 형성에도 굉장히 많은 영향을 줬다. 그리고 필자는 이 Respect 정신을 비보잉을 하던 음악을 하던 프로그래밍을 하던 항상 똑같이 적용해왔다. 어떤 분이 프로그래밍을 하는 직업을 가지거나 지금 프로그래밍을 공부하고 있는 분이라고 하면 그 자체만으로도 그 분을 개발자로써 존중해야 한다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이 정신을 마음 속에 품고 다른 개발자와 이야기를 나눈다면 더 이상 그 사람의 경력은 중요하지 않다. 어제 처음 입사한 신입 개발자든 이 바닥에서 10년 넘게 구른 시니어 개발자든 “우리는 개발자”라는 사실 앞에서 평등하다. 물론 시니어는 그 동안 겪어온 짬이 있기 때문에 주니어보다 더 프로그래밍을 잘할 수 있다. 하지만 순수하게 기술력만을 놓고 본다면 시니어보다 잘하는 주니어도 많다는 사실을 잊지 말자. 단순히 상대방이 나보다 경력이 적다는 이유로, 어리다는 이유로 무시하면 안된다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>뭐 가끔은 얘기하다보면 상대방이 논리적으로 틀린 말을 할 수도 있지만 그렇다고 “이런 것도 몰라?”라고 면박주는 것이 아니라 잘못된 것에 대해서 제대로 피드백을 줄 수 있는 성숙한 마음을 가지자. 또 누군가 나에게 피드백을 준다면 그 사람이 초등학교 갓 졸업한 14살짜리 개발자일지라도 그 피드백에 대해서 고민 해볼 수 있는 마인드를 가져야한다.</p>\n<p>프로그래밍을 업으로써 본인이 먹고 살수 있다면 신입이든 시니어든 개발자는 개발자다. 그러니까 항상 같이 일하는 동료를 존중하는 마음을 가지자. 동료들이 팀 내에서 자기 능력을 존중받는다고 느낀다면 결국 여러분에게도 그 존중은 돌아오게 되어있다. 서로 존중받지 못하는 팀에 개인의 행복은 있을 수 없다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"조직-안에서-나의-행복을-찾아보자\" style=\"position:relative;\">조직 안에서 나의 행복을 찾아보자<a

넘겨서도 곤란하다. 그리고 필자가 말하고 싶은 행복이라는 것은 생각보다 거창한 개념이 아니다.</p>\n<p>사실 필자는 “아 행복해~“라는 감정과는 굉장히 거리가 먼 사람이다. 그렇다고 불행하다는 것은 아니고 “내가 지금 행복한 상태인가?”와 같은 질문을 스스로에게 해본 적이 별로 없기 때문에 “난 지금 행복해!”라는 생각도 안하는 것이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자가 말하는 행복은 단지 불행하지 않은 상태라고 봐도 무방하다. 개발자다운 이분법적인 생각일수도 있지만, 행복이란 것은 자기 마음먹기 나름이기 때문에 필자는 결국 행복한 게 맞는 것 같다.</p>\n<p>하지만 우리가 일반적으로 생각하는 행복은 뭐랄까… 연봉이 20% 인상되었을 때와 같은 행복인 경우가 많은 것 같다. <small>(정확하게 뭐라 말로 표현 못하겠다)</small> 하지만 이런 류의 행복은 쳇바퀴와도 같아서 내가 연봉이 20% 올랐어도 결국 금방 또 다음 단계의 행복을 찾아나서게 된다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>오 연봉이 4천이 됐다! 근데 세금을 너무 많이 떼가네…? 한 달에 400만원만 벌어봤으면 좋겠는데…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>물론 연봉이 올라서 느끼는 감정도 행복일 수 있지만 필자가 말하는 행복은 이런 행복이 아니다. 그것보다는 좀 더 소박한, 필자가 방금 얘기한 것 같이 “난 딱히 불행한 상태가 아니잖아? 그럼 나름 행복한 것 같은데?”과 같은 작은 행복이다.</p>\n<p>그리고 이 행복의 기준은 사람마다 너무 다르기 때문에 콕 찝어서 뭐라 말하기는 힘들다. 어떤 사람은 행복의 기준이 무조건 돈일 수도 있고 어떤 사람은 그냥 아침에 출근할 때 상쾌한 바람 냄새만 맡아도 행복할 수 있기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>그렇기 때문에 한번 필자의 기준을 토대로 이야기해보겠다. 필자의 기준도 어떤 이에게는 이해가 안될 수도 있겠지만 그냥 “이런 사람도 있구나” 정도로 받아들이도록 하자.</p>\n<p>일단 필자는 굉장히 직선적인 성격이다. 아니다 싶으면 아니라고 말하고 맞다 싶으면 맞다고 말하는 그런 사람이다. 직장에서는 50명 가까운 사람들이 모여있는 자리에서 지금 우리가 하고 있는 데이터 기반 의사결정이 진짜로 우리 유저들을 위한 것이 아니라 순전히 우리의 지표를 위한 결정이라고 비판하며 우리 회사가 잘못하고 있는 점을 거의 한시간 동안 하나하나 지적한 적도 있었다.</p>\n<p>필자의 이런 행동들을 보고 어떤 사람들은 자신의 마음을 대변해줘서 고맙다고 하는 사람도 있었지만 반면에 너무 직선적이라 걱정된다고 해주시는 분도 있었다. <small>(다른 회사는 더 하면 더 하다는 말과 함께…)</small></p>\n<p>물론 필자도 이런 성격이 사회 통념 상 안좋게 보일 수도 있다는 사실은 당연히 알고 있고, 또 그냥 있는 듯 없는 듯 살며 사회에 맞출 수도 있다. 군대에서는 필자의 직선적인 성격을 다 숨기고 그냥 까라면 까는 충실한 군인이기도 했기 때문에 뭐 지금도 그렇게 다시 하라고 한다면 못할 것도 없지 않은가.</p>\n<p>그리고 CEO를 포함한 전직원이 있는 자리에서 회사 전체를 비판하며 나 혼자만 외롭게 얘기한다는 것은 솔직히 쉬운 일은 아니다. 이런 상황에서 왠만한 사람은 다 긴장할 수 밖에 없고, 혹시 내가 틀렸으면 어떡하나라는 생각도 들기 마련이다. 그래서 이 얘기를 하기로 마음먹은 후에는 거의 매일 새벽 2-3시까지 논문부터 학술자료나 사례까지 닥치는 대로 찾아봤었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 이런 장애물을 다 넘어서 결국 필자가 이렇게 행동할 수 있었던 이유는 필자가 어떤 조직의 조직원으로써 느끼는 행복의 기준이 바로 내가 만드는 것이 사람들을 도울 수 있는 무언가가 되는 것이기 때문이다. 그렇기 때문에 데이터 기반 의사결정을 비판할 때도 많은 사람들 앞에서</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>난 전환율이나 매출같은 지표를 올리기 위한 프로덕트를 만드는 것이 아니라, 진짜로 사람들이 우리 서비스를 통해 좋은 경험을 얻어갈 수 있는 그런 프로덕트를 만들고 싶다.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>라고 자신의 의견을 이야기할 수 있었던 것이다. 그리고 저렇게 한바탕 이야기하고 난 뒤 많은 분들이 공감을 해주셔서 결국 회사가 좋은 방향으로 바뀌긴 했다. 이게 진짜 잘한건지 아닌건지는 아직도 고민 중이긴 하지만…</p>\n<p>어쨌든 이런 과정을 통해 결국 필자는 “내가 이 프로덕트를 만들면 유저에게 어떤 도움이 되는지”를 공감하면서 프로덕트를 개발할 수 있었고 결과적으로 만족했다. 조직 내에서 자기만의 행복을 찾는 방법은 이렇게 적극적인 방법부터 조심스러운 방법까지 아주 다양한 방법이 있으니 한번 퇴근 후 집에서 “내 행복의 기준은 무엇일까”라는 고민을 한번쯤은 다들 해보았으면 좋겠다.</p>\n<h3

필자의 경험상 이 내용과 가장 알맞는 예시는 바로 돈이다.</p>\n<p>필자는 재작년인 2017년까지만 해도 돈에 굉장히 민감했었다. 이게 어느 정도였냐면, 한달에 30만원으로 살던 시절이었다. 교통비, 담배값, 밥값 다 합쳐서 30만원이다. 대학생 때 그렇게 살던게 직장인이 되어서도 계속 습관처럼 굳어진 것인데, 이 내면에는 “돈을 빨리 모아서 집이라도 하나 사놔야지”라는 욕구가 있었던 것 같다. 뭐 이런 생각은 필자 나이 또래의 모두가 하는 생각이니 그렇게 특별한 생각은 아니다.</p>\n<p>근데 필자는 조금 도가 지나쳤던 것이, 한달에 30만원으로만 살면 옷을 사거나 머리를 하거나 친구들이랑 술 한잔하는 그런 건 솔직히 힘들다. 그리고 결정적으로 돈은 내가 모으고 싶다고해서 그렇게 팍팍 모이는 것이 아니다. 필자가 한달에 30만원씩 쓰면서 돈을 모으고 모아도 필자의 목표에는 거의 다가가지 못하고 있었다.</p>\n<p>그래서 어느 날 갑자기 이렇게 돈만 모으면서 사는 것에 대해서 회의감도 들고 조금 지쳐서 무기력한 상태가 지속되었던 적이 있었는데, 그 당시 필자가 다녔던 직장의 CTO와 티타임을 가지며 “내가 이렇게 사는 게 맞는 지 모르겠다”는 느낌의 얘기를 나눴었던 적이 있다.</p>\n<p>근데 사실 필자의 마음은 이미 답정너였다. 그냥 “엄살부리지말고 더 열심히 모아!”라는 소리가 듣고 싶었던 것이다. 하지만 그 형님에게서는 의외의 대답이 돌아왔다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>어차피 마티즈 탈 운명인 놈이 아무리 열심히 해봤자 소나타정도 타겠지. 벤츠는 절대 못타.<br />\n마찬가지로 에반이 돈을 아무리 열심히 모아도 운좋게 뭐라도 되지 않는 이상 방 2개인 집이 방 3개인 집이 되는 그 정도 차이야.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>이 말은 어떻게 보면 굉장히 냉정하게 들릴 수 있는 말이었지만 필자는 이때 많은 것을 느꼈던 것 같다. “방 두칸이 세칸이 되면 내가 행복해질까?” 하는 그런 고민을 그때부터 했던 것 같다. 오랜 기간 고민을 해봤지만 꼴랑 방 한칸이 필자 인생에서 그렇게 큰 비중을 차지할 수는 없을 것 같았기에 “그냥 생긴대로 살자”라는 결론을 내리게 되었다. <small>(그리고 본격적으로 주식을 시작했다…)</small></p>\n<p>물론 위에서 한번 얘기했던 연봉도 마찬가지다. 연봉이 오르면 기분이 좋을 수는 있다. 하지만 그 좋은 기분은 잠깐이다. 사람 마음이라는 것이 워낙 간사하기 때문에 내가 연봉이 20%가 올라도 한 6개월 정도 지나면 또 20%를 올리고 싶어질 것이다. 하지만 좋은 기회로 이직이라도 하지 않는 이상 그건 불가능하다.</p>\n<p>게다가 연봉이 2천만원에서 3천만원이 될 때는 상승폭이 크게 느껴지지만 3천에서 4천, 4천에서 5천이 되면 세금을 점점 많이 떼어가기 때문에 실질적으로 들어오는 실수령액은 그렇게 큰 차이가 나지 않는다.</p>\n<p>필자가 이런 이야기를 하는 이유는 바로 돈이라는 것이 내 뜻대로 되는 것이 아니기 때문이다. 만약 돈을 많이 벌고 싶어하는 사람들이 전부 돈을 많이 벌 수 있었다면 세상에는 부자들 밖에 없을 것이다. 연봉이 오르는 것, 책 집필 같이 새로운 수입이 생기는 것 등은 어느 정도 운빨도 필요하다. 100% 실력으로 승부할 수 있는 것이 아니라는 것이다.</p>\n<p>그래서 필자는 이런 생각 끝에 “그냥 열심히 코딩이나 하자. 돈은 언젠가 따라오겠지.”라는 마음으로 나름 행복하게 지내고 있다. 마음대로 컨트롤할 수 없는 돈에 집착하는 것은 뭔가 짝사랑과 비슷한 느낌이라 굉장히 힘든 것 같다. 그냥 남는 돈은 구글이나 엔비디아같은 대형주에 부어놓고 하늘에 맡기도록 하자.</p>\n<h2 id=\"마치며\" style=\"position:relative;\">마치며<a href=\"#%EB%A7%88%EC%B9%98%EB%A9%B0\" aria-label=\"마치며 permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"

우선순위에서 밀리는 경우가 많기 때문에 현실적으로 “회사에서 알아서 좋은 조직문화를 만들어주겠지”라고 기대하기에는 조금 무리가 있다고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>하지만 위에서 설명했듯이 당장 우리도 팀을 위해, 조직을 위해 할 수 있는 일들이 있다. 나부터 행복해지자는 말은 언뜻 보면 나만 행복해지자는 말 같지만 처음에 이야기 했듯이 결국 나 개인의 행복은 우리 팀의 행복이 될 수도 있고, 더 나아가서 암묵적으로 행복한 조직문화를 형성할 수도 있다.</p>\n<p>사실 필자가 이야기한 내용들은 필자의 경험을 기반으로 한 주관적인 내용들이기 때문에 공감하지 못할 수도 있다. 하지만 필자가 이 글을 통해 하고 싶었던 말은 “나처럼 행복해져라”가 아니라 지금 당장 여러분이 조직문화를 위해 할 수 있는 작은 일들이 있다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>우리는 비록 월급받고 일하는 월급쟁이 개발자이지만 결국 어떤 조직의 일원이고, 또 그 조직을 위해서 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 프로그래밍말고도 많이 있다고 생각한다. 그리고 우리가 그렇게 조직문화에 대해서 관심과 개선하고 싶다는 의지를 가지고 조금씩 노력하다보면 어쩌면 10년 후에 새로 입사한 개발자들은 우리보다 더 재밌고 행복하고 건설적인 환경에서 일할 수도 있지 않을까?</p>\n<p>이상으로 개발자가 조직문화에 대해 관심을 가져야 하는 이유 포스팅을 마친다.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190806-developer-with-organizational-culture","path":"/2019/08/06/developer-with-organizational-culture/","lang":"ko"},"frontmatter":{"title":"개발자가 조직문화에 대해 관심을 가져야 하는
