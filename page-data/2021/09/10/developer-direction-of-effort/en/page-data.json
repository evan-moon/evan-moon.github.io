Common examples include daily commits (1 commit per day), writing TIL (Today I Learned) posts, and clone coding. In mentoring sessions and interviews, I see a remarkable number of junior developers engaging in these activities.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/07d7d/contributions.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAABBklEQVR42h2O21KCUABF+f8/qabppcnKptKki6WN2qQoGmDckcMBQVBzxfi2935YaytZkTP2ZvxmLvPYRAvmiEIS5YJxNEcLF0RZjJk6zGIDp/DRpYWd+7hlgC5MvoWOnhhsdiVKICJUp88g0rizn3nwXuiEfYZ1V4Mej8s3hr7GuBZdW21uww5PfpfRasqZ3eDUaNDyuvSTL6JKoCRlipb+sJBLLs17mo5aw6Z4acir+OTcuKHtvfPhjWhaKld2qwb2mEmTC7PJyeSSkdSOgnJfoVT7Lb6MCOQKJ/ZZCpckTY/35X5NUmakuzWiSlnvcuS23upc/G0QG4mbBQxWExa+xeFw4B9gECNpMFTS+QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"contributions\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/6af66/contributions.png\" srcset=\"/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/69538/contributions.png 160w,\n/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/72799/contributions.png 320w,\n/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/6af66/contributions.png 640w,\n/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/d9199/contributions.png 960w,\n/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/21b4d/contributions.png 1280w,\n/static/39cecaa3a513c543dbe8543953b2ff61/07d7d/contributions.png 1478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The contribution graph on a GitHub profile is data showing how active someone is in development-related activities.</small>\n</center>\n<p>Of course, doing <em>something</em> for your growth is a great attitude. But blindly jumping in because everyone else is doing it, or because a bootcamp told you it’s necessary for landing a job, may not be the best approach.</p>\n<p>If you’re just starting out, simply committing every day or writing down what you learned on a blog might generate some growth. That’s because at this stage, rapidly getting comfortable with coding directly translates to growth.</p>\n<p>But as you know, this phase passes fairly quickly. The more comfortable you get with coding, the more you encounter familiar things rather than new ones — and from that point on, simply coding alone makes it increasingly difficult to improve or learn something new.</p>\n<p>Eventually, you start to feel that daily commits or TIL posts alone aren’t producing the same growth velocity they used to. And that’s when this question hits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What should I study next to go further? What kind of effort should I be making now?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the state of putting in effort without a clear direction. You need to nail both the <em>volume</em> and the <em>direction</em> of your effort — only then can you get maximum return on the same amount of investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thinking-about-the-cost-of-effort\" style=\"position:relative;\">Thinking About the Cost of Effort<a href=\"#thinking-about-the-cost-of-effort\" aria-label=\"thinking about the cost of effort permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>People tend to think of the effort they put into achieving something as a kind of cost — and it genuinely is. You’re investing your time and energy to create new value. That’s why we instinctively seek the most efficient form of effort — the direction where minimal input yields maximum return.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s no predetermined shortcut in life. But you can gradually improve your effort’s efficiency by constantly asking yourself where the right direction might be. The method that maximizes efficiency differs from person to person, and the only way to find it is through your own reflection.</p>\n<p>The problem is that many people can’t afford the mental space for this kind of reflection. Someone who experienced rapid growth through daily commits or TIL tends to think “I’m not growing because I’m not trying hard enough” — because of that past experience, or simply out of inertia.</p>\n<p>But as I mentioned, misdirected effort leads to lower efficiency, and lower efficiency means the value of what your effort produces decreases.</p>\n<p>For those who aren’t sure what “the value of your effort decreasing” means, I want to explain this from two perspectives: the market perspective and the perspective of continuous personal growth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-market-perspective\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Market Perspective<a href=\"#the-market-perspective\" aria-label=\"the market perspective permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>First, the place where the returns on your effort shine most brightly is the job market. And since the job market is literally a market, most of the principles we know about markets apply.</p>\n<p>The principle I want to discuss is “inflation.” The basic definition of inflation is when something becomes so common in the market that its value drops. Usually we talk about the value of money dropping, but in the job market, think of it as the value of skills or credentials.</p>\n<p>The most classic example of this inflation is education. In the 1970s, having a college degree commanded respect and gave you a significant advantage in job hunting. But by the 2020s, with college enrollment rates approaching 79%, simply having a bachelor’s degree no longer carries much weight.</p>\n<p>In other words, the bachelor’s degree we spent 12 years earning — from elementary school through college entrance exams — has become something that most people in the job market possess. It’s become an ordinary commodity, and an ordinary commodity that everyone has is, by definition, one that has lost its value.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 512px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/16a130e56cdf12fffd6fd91b275a887d/36dd4/graduate.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"graduate\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/16a130e56cdf12fffd6fd91b275a887d/36dd4/graduate.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/16a130e56cdf12fffd6fd91b275a887d/0913d/graduate.jpg 160w,\n/static/16a130e56cdf12fffd6fd91b275a887d/cb69c/graduate.jpg 320w,\n/static/16a130e56cdf12fffd6fd91b275a887d/36dd4/graduate.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    As of 2021, the proportion of college graduates has grown compared to the past,<br>\n    and having a degree no longer signals that you're an exceptional talent.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>This is a fundamental market principle: when everyone has something, its value drops. And this principle applies to hiring as well. The job market is essentially a jungle of supply and demand where you have to compete against others to survive.</p>\n<p>To survive in this jungle, you need to demonstrate that you’re better at the job than others, that you have higher growth potential — sending the message “invest in me and you won’t regret it” to companies, our consumers. That’s why people try so hard to graduate from good universities, earn certifications, and study abroad.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: you need to be a differentiated person, a desirable product in the job market. This is no different for developers — the only difference is that the differentiation criteria focus on programming skills rather than credentials.</p>\n<p>But the problem is that many people don’t think deeply about whether a particular asset will serve as a weapon in the job market — or whether it’s a weapon at all. They just think they need it because other people already have it. Much like our parents told us we absolutely must graduate college to make a living.</p>\n<p>Sure, having it is probably better than not having it. But relative to the 12 years of effort you invested, a bachelor’s degree probably doesn’t guarantee proportional value. This is especially true in the IT industry, which values ability over credentials.</p>\n<p>Similarly, activities like daily commits, TIL, and clone coding are already widely known. Bootcamps are even providing explicit guidance that these activities help with getting hired. When reviewing résumés, I can definitely feel that far more people are doing these activities than before.</p>\n<p>In other words, these activities have become commodities that too many people possess. Simply having done them no longer makes a strong impression on an interviewer — just like a bachelor’s degree.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-perspective-of-continuous-personal-growth\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Perspective of Continuous Personal Growth<a href=\"#the-perspective-of-continuous-personal-growth\" aria-label=\"the perspective of continuous personal growth permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Second, as I mentioned, activities like daily commits, TIL, and clone coding only generate meaningful growth during the very earliest stages of learning to code. There are limits to what you can achieve by simply being exposed to coding frequently.</p>\n<p>Moreover, since these activities emphasize consistency, they can easily become mere habits. You end up just “doing them” without deeply considering what you’re learning from them or why you’re doing them in the first place.</p>\n<p>The reasons people fall into this habit vary — inertia from having done it consistently, anxiety about falling behind if they stop — but regardless of the reason, continuing to pour effort in without clear direction can never produce sustained growth.</p>\n<p>Worse, if you forget the original purpose of these activities and just repeat them mechanically, there’s a risk of becoming fixated on results over purpose — making meaningless commits to fill the daily quota, or even faking commit timestamps. This is actually a recurring theme in many people’s retrospectives on daily commits.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, even if you have both the passion for growth and the energy to execute, if you can’t define a clear direction for yourself, your energy might end up invested in the wrong places.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-should-i-do\" style=\"position:relative;\">So What Should I Do?<a href=\"#so-what-should-i-do\" aria-label=\"so what should i do permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Alright, so what should you actually do?

Let me use the popular activity of daily commits as an example.</p>\n<p>The act of “one commit per day” means nothing more and nothing less than making at least one commit each day. If you focus on the act itself, when someone asks “Why do you do daily commits?”, you can only answer with something like “Because it’s important to do something consistently.”</p>\n<p>But as I discussed, once you’re past the very earliest stage of learning to code, mere consistency alone can’t produce sustained growth. If you’ve reached this stage, it’s time to ask yourself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the essential value that daily commits create?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answer will differ for each person, but I believe the essential value of daily commits is closer to “consistently working on my own development projects without letting go.”</p>\n<p>In other words, the “commit” in “daily commit” doesn’t mean any random commit — it means commits toward building your own side project, contributing to open source, and so on.</p>\n<p>As you know, a commit is ultimately part of the process of building something.

Providing customized education for every individual is prohibitively expensive, which is why they end up creating standardized curricula and funneling people through them. <em>(Most of the education industry works this way, honestly.)</em></p>\n<p>So I asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Why does writing TIL posts on your blog help with getting hired?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I asked because I believe hiring involves an enormous number of variables — company size, current business conditions, the talent pool in the market, existing team members’ capacity — and I wasn’t convinced that any specific activity would universally help with employment.</p>\n<p>The answer I got was: “Isn’t it data that shows diligence?”</p>\n<p>Honestly, learning something new every single day and writing about it on a blog is no small feat. How can anyone possibly learn something new every single day?</p>\n<p>Of course, a developer who just started coding might encounter new knowledge daily. But the more comfortable you get with coding, the less that happens. You <em>can</em> sustain this pattern by actively seeking out new knowledge, but it takes considerable effort.</p>\n<p>And if the result of all that effort is merely to demonstrate “diligence” — well, personally, I don’t think that’s a good trade.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because <strong>companies don’t hire people based on diligence alone.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Companies exist to generate profit. So naturally, when they hire, they want people who will earn back more than what’s invested in them. Diligence might be one criterion for evaluating such people, but it’s not a critical factor. If someone is a bit lazier than average but does great work, helps the team grow, and generates revenue — that’s fine.</p>\n<p>On top of that, as I mentioned, TIL is already a widely recommended activity across multiple bootcamps, and many junior developers are doing it. Inflation has already arrived — simply having done it consistently is no longer that attractive in the job market.</p>\n<p>So if you want TIL to be your weapon, you need something beyond mere consistency and diligence — something that differentiates you. For instance, diving deep into areas most people don’t study, or showing an extraordinary five-year streak of TIL posts without missing a single day.</p>\n<p>To create these differentiating factors, you need to think about what value TIL truly provides.</p>\n<p>TIL isn’t something you do to get hired. It’s an archive where you observe, learn, and record things to hand off to your future self. Yet many people write TIL posts as little more than rough, unorganized notes. And with notes that disorganized, revisiting them a year or two later for review won’t be easy.</p>\n<p>This is a textbook example of using a good tool in a bad way. If you’ve been doing TIL or daily commits for the sake of employment, it’s time to reflect on what value you can genuinely extract from these activities and how that value can fuel your growth.</p>\n<p>Nobody else will do this thinking for you, and no one will teach you the answer. It certainly won’t come quickly, but I recommend practicing — even just a little each day — the habit of questioning whether what you’re currently doing truly has meaning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"build-intrinsic-motivation\" style=\"position:relative;\">Build Intrinsic Motivation<a href=\"#build-intrinsic-motivation\" aria-label=\"build intrinsic motivation permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The last thing I want to talk about is building intrinsic motivation. This connects to the earlier discussion about “activities done for the sake of getting hired or changing jobs” — because landing a job or making a career move is the quintessential example of external motivation.</p>\n<p>Imagine you’ve been diligently doing daily commits or TIL to get hired.</p>\n<p>The developer market currently has more demand than supply, and company founders are always asking “Know any good developers?” — so you’ll probably land a job eventually. <em>(Everyone feels anxious during the process, but people tend to land jobs more easily than they expect.)</em></p>\n<p>OK, so you’ve achieved your goal. Should you keep doing daily commits or TIL?</p>\n<p>Maybe inertia carries you for a while. But once you start adapting to new people, new code, and a new environment at your job, it’s easy to stop — because you’re tired, or because adapting to the job takes priority over personal development.</p>\n<p>The reason you stop might not actually matter that much. Because the moment you achieved your goal of getting hired, the very motivation to continue these labor-intensive, diligence-demanding activities simply vanished.</p>\n<p>This is the fundamental problem with external motivation. Behavior driven by external motivation is easily abandoned the moment the source of that motivation disappears.</p>\n<p>That’s why motivation should stem from intrinsic sources — like growth and genuine interest — rather than external conditions like employment or job changes.</p>\n<p>Intrinsic motivation can also collapse due to internal factors like burnout, but at least it’s far more robust than motivation that evaporates the instant you hit your target.</p>\n<p>Even if you’ve never deeply considered external versus intrinsic motivation, everyone instinctively knows which one is more robust.</p>\n<p>If you were an interviewer and asked “Why do you write TIL?”, would you trust the person who says “To get hired” more, or the person who says “Because I enjoy developing” or “Because it helps me grow”?</p>\n<p>The first answer naturally provokes the thought: “So they’ll stop once they’re hired?” And that reaction is exactly the risk that external motivation creates.</p>\n<p>Of course, most people nod in agreement when I explain it with examples like this. But the truth is, we’re all very accustomed to lives driven by external motivation — and even I, the one writing this, find myself increasingly dependent on the external motivation of money as I get older. <del><em>(Housing prices are absolutely maddening…)</em></del></p>\n<p>Ultimately, what I want to say in this post isn’t that you should eliminate external motivation entirely. That’s impossible, and sometimes external motivation can create even greater momentum. But I do think it’s worth reflecting at least once on whether the motivation you’re currently depending on is sustainable going forward, and whether it truly helps your growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\">Closing thoughts<a href=\"#closing-thoughts\" aria-label=\"closing thoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This might sound somewhat idealistic. After all, if you’re in an urgent, desperate situation where you need a job right now, it’s hard to find the headspace for this kind of reflection.</p>\n<p>But everything I’ve discussed in this post will absolutely help your job search and career moves. Your real enemy is the anxiety whispering inside you: “Everyone else is working hard while I’m wasting time on these thoughts” or “I don’t have time to think — I just need to do something.”</p>\n<p>Developers with relatively little experience often don’t have many weapons to showcase in the job market. So to put their best foot forward in interviews, they focus on fundamentals like algorithm problems and language comprehension, or on immediately actionable activities like daily commits.</p>\n<p>Studying fundamentals is indeed essential — you could call it a developer’s basic literacy. And activities like daily commits or TIL can help you demonstrate qualities like diligence. But what matters is that interviewers ultimately aren’t looking for someone who’s merely knowledgeable in theory or just diligent — they’re looking for someone who can “get things done, whatever it takes.”</p>\n<p>In other words, you need a strategy to stand out as a compelling talent in the job market. And crafting that strategy requires “effort with a clear direction.”</p>\n<p>Before starting anything, try visualizing what you want from this effort and who you want to become. Establish your direction, then execute. If you keep practicing this, I believe you’ll eventually develop your own know-how and strategy to showcase what makes you special in the market.</p>\n<p>This concludes my post: How to Find Your Own

가치를 창출해내는 것이니 말이다. 그렇기 때문에 본능적으로 가장 효율적인 노력, 즉, 내가 최소의 노력을 들여서 최대의 이윤을 얻을 수 있는 방향을 찾고자 한다.</p>\n<p>안타깝지만 세상에 그렇게 정답이 정해진 지름길은 없다. 다만, 스스로 올바른 노력의 방향이 어디일지를 끊임없이 고민하며 내 노력의 효율을 조금씩 높혀볼 수는 있다. 왜냐하면 노력의 효율이 극대화되는 방법은 사람마다 다르고, 그 방법이 무엇인지는 본인이 스스로 고민해봐야 알 수 있기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 문제는 많은 분들이 이런 고민을 진지하게 해볼 수 있는 여유를 가지지 못 한다는 것이다. 지금까지 1일 1커밋이나 TIL을 통해 빠른 성장을 경험했던 사람은 그 경험 때문에, 혹은 관성 때문에 “내가 노력이 부족해서 성장을 못 하는 거야”라고 생각하기 쉽기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 앞서 이야기 했듯이 잘못된 방향성으로 인해 노력의 효율은 떨어질 수 있으며, 노력의 효율이 떨어진다는 것을 다른 말로 하면 내 노력으로 만들어낸 무언가의 가치가 떨어진다고 볼 수도 있다.</p>\n<p>내 노력으로 만들어낸 무언가의 가치가 떨어진다는 것이 어떤 의미인지 잘 이해가 가지 않는 분들을 위해, 크게 두 가지의 시각에서 이 부분을 이야기하려고 한다. 첫 번째는 시장에서의 시각, 그리고 두 번째는 개인의 지속적인 성장에 대한 시각이다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"시장에서의-시각\" style=\"position:relative;\">시장에서의 시각<a

“인플레이션”이다. 인플레이션의 기본적인 정의는 시장 내에서 어떤 재화가 평범한 것이 되어버리면서 가치가 떨어지는 것이다. 이때 보통은 돈의 가치가 떨어지는 상황을 많이 이야기하지만, 채용 시장에서는 능력이나 경력의 가치라고 보면 될 것이다.</p>\n<p>이러한 인플레이션의 가장 대표적인 예는 바로 학력이다. 예를 들어 1970년대에 대학을 나온 사람은 어느 정도 인정도 받고 취업에도 꽤나 유리한 위치를 점할 수 있었지만, 2020년대에는 대학 진학률 자체가 79%에 육박하게 되면서 대학을 졸업하고 학사 학위를 가지고 있다는 것 자체가 큰 메리트가 되지 않는다는 상황을 생각해보면 된다.</p>\n<p>즉, 우리가 초딩 때부터 고3 수능 때까지 장장 12년의 노력을 들여서 따낸 이 학사 학위는 이제 채용 시장에 나와있는 대부분의 사람들이 가치고 있는 것이 되어버렸기 때문에, 예전에 비해 학사 학위라는 것이 굉장히 평범한 재화가 되어버렸다는 것이다. 누구나 가지고 있는 평범한 재화가 되었다는 것은 결국 가치가 떨어졌다는 말과 똑같다.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"

이루어진, 다른 사람과 경쟁해서 살아야 하는 정글이나 마찬가지이기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>즉, 이 정글에서 살아남기 위해서는 내가 남들보다 더 일을 잘한다, 내가 남들보다 더 성장 가능성이 높다는 것을 어필하며 “나한테 투자하면 절대 손해보지 않을걸?”이라는 메세지를 우리들의 소비자인 기업들에게 던져야 한다는 것이고, 그렇기 때문에 사람들이 어떻게 해서든 좋은 대학을 졸업하고 자격증도 따고 어학 연수도 다녀오고 하는 것이다.</p>\n<p>결국 남들과 차별화된 사람, 가지고 싶은 상품이 되어야 취업 시장에서 유리하다는 것이며, 이는 개발자라고 해서 크게 다르지 않다. 다만 그 차별점이 학력이나 자격증이 아니라 프로그래밍 실력과 같은 기준에 초점이 맞춰져 있을 뿐이다.</p>\n<p>하지만 문제는 많은 사람들이 이 가치가 채용 시장에서 나에게 어떤 무기가 될 지, 혹은 아예 무기가 될 수 없는지는 깊게 생각하지 않고, 그저 다른 사람들이 이미 가지고 있기 때문에 나도 갖춰야 한다고 생각한다는 것이다. 마치 부모님이 우리에게 대한민국에서 먹고 살려면 무조건 대학은 나와야한다고 말씀하셨던 것처럼 말이다.</p>\n<p>물론 없는 것보다는 있는 게 나을 수도 있다. 하지만 여러분이 들인 12년 동안 노력에 비해 학사 학위라는 것이 그 만큼의 가치를 보장하지는 않을 것이다. 특히 학력보다 실력을 더 중요하게 생각하는 이 IT 업계에서는 더 그렇다고 생각한다.</p>\n<p>마찬가지로 1일 1커밋, TIL, 클론 코딩과 같은 활동들은 이미 많은 사람들에게 알려져버린 활동들이며, 심지어 부트캠프 같은 곳에서는 이런 활동들을 해야 취업에 도움이 된다는 가이드까지 주고 있다. 확실히 이력서를 보다보면 예전에 비해 확실히 이런 활동을 하시는 분들이 많다는 것이 체감되기도 한다.</p>\n<p>즉, 이런 활동들은 이제 너무나도 많은 사람들이 하고 있는 재화가 되었기 때문에, 이제 단순히 이런 활동을 했다는 것만으로는 면접관에게 어떠한 감명을 주기 어려워졌다는 것이다. 마치

생각한다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>왜냐하면 기업은 <strong>성실함만으로 사람을 채용하지 않기 때문이다.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>기업은 애초에 금전적인 이윤을 만들어 내기 위한 집단이다. 그러니 당연히 사람을 채용할 때도 투자한 금액보다 더 돈을 많이 벌어다 줄 수 있는 사람을 원하는 것이다. 성실함은 그런 사람을 판단할 수 있는 기준 중 하나가 될 수는 있겠지만, 중요한 팩터는 아니다. 남들 보다 조금 게으르더라도 일 잘 하고 팀을 성장시킬 수 있으며 돈을 만들어 낼 수 있는 사람이라면 상관없다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>게다가 앞서 이야기했듯이 TIL은 이미 여러 부트캠프들이 가이드하고 있는 활동이고 실제로도 많은 주니어 개발자 분들이 하고 있는 활동이기 때문에 이미 인플레이션이 왔고, 이 활동을 꾸준히 했다는 것만으로는 이제 채용 시장에서 그렇게 매력적으로 보이지 않는다.</p>\n<p>즉, 여러분이 TIL을 여러분의 무기로 삼고 싶다면 단순히 꾸준함과 성실함 뿐만 아니라 남들과 차별화 될 수 있는 무언가가 더 얹어져야 한다. 예를 들어 남들이 잘 공부하지 않는 부분들을 깊게 판다던가, 5년이라는 엄청난 시간동안 하루도 빼먹지 않고 매일 TIL을 적는 미친 성실함을 보여준다던가 하는 것처럼 말이다.</p>\n<p>이런 차별 요소를 만들어내기 위해서는 이 TIL이라는 것이 주는 진정한 가치가 무엇인지를 한번 고민해봐야 한다.</p>\n<p>TIL은 취업하기 위해서 하는 활동이 아니라 실제로 여러분이 뭔가를 보고 배우고 기록하여 미래의 자신에게 건네주기 위한 아카이브이다. 하지만 많은 분들이 TIL을 작성할 때 정돈되지 않은 메모 정도의 글을 적는다. 그리고 이렇게 정돈되지 않은 글을 적어놓았으니 1-2년 뒤에 다시 예전에 적어둔 TIL을 복기하며 공부하기도 쉽지 않을 것이다.</p>\n<p>이게 바로 TIL이라는 좋은 도구를 좋지 않은 수단으로 사용하고 있는 대표적인 상황이다. 지금까지 TIL이나 1일 1커밋과 같은 행위들을 취업을 위해 하고 있었다면, 이제는 이 활동들을 통해 내가 진짜로 얻을 수 있는 가치가 무엇인지, 그리고 그 가치가 나를 어떻게 성장시킬 수 있을 지에 대해서 스스로 고민해보자.</p>\n<p>이런 고민은 그 누구도 여러분을 대신해서 해주지 않으며, 고민에 대한 정답은 어디에서도 가르쳐 주지 않는다. 물론 빠른 시간 안에 답이 나오는 고민은 아니겠지만, 매일매일 조금씩이라도 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 활동이 진정 의미가 있는 것인지 고민해보는 연습을 해보는 것을 추천한다.</p>\n<h3 id=\"내재적인-모티베이션을-만들자\" style=\"position:relative;\">내재적인 모티베이션을 만들자<a

맥락인데, 이 취업이나 이직이라는 목표가 외부적인 모티베이션의 가장 대표적인 예이기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>만약 취업이나 이직을 위해 매일 1일 1커밋이나 TIL을 꾸준히 했다고 생각해보자.</p>\n<p>현재 개발자 시장은 공급에 비해 수요가 많은 상황이고, 이런 저런 회사의 대표님들은 항상 “주변에 좋은 개발자 없어요?”라는 질문을 뿌리고 다니는 세상이니 분명 언젠가는 취업이나 이직을 성공할 수 있을 것이다. <small>(당연히 채용 과정 중에는 다들 불안해하지만 생각보다 척척 잘 붙는다)</small></p>\n<p>자, 그러면 여러분은 이제 목표를 이뤘는데, 1일 1커밋이나 TIL을 계속 해야 할까?</p>\n<p>물론 지금까지 해오던 관성이 있기 때문에 계속 이어나갈 수 있을지도 모른다. 하지만 입사 후 새로운 사람들, 새로운 코드, 새로운 환경에 적응하다 보면 피곤하다는 이유로, 지금은 자기 계발보다는 회사 일에 적응하는 것이 우선이라는 이유로 쉽게 그만 두게 된다.</p>\n<p>사실 이런 행위들을 그만 두게 되는 이유는 그렇게 중요하지 않을 지도 모른다. 왜냐하면 여러분이 취업이나 이직이라는 목표를 달성함과 동시에, 1일 1커밋이나 TIL처럼 엄청난 노동력과 성실함이 필요한 작업을 계속 이어가야 하는 모티베이션 자체가 사라졌기 때문이다.</p>\n<p>이것이 바로 외부적인 모티베이션의 문제점이다. 외부에서 오는 모티베이션에 의존한 행위는 그 모티베이션의 원천이 사라지는 순간 쉽게 그만 두게 되기 쉽다.</p>\n<p>그렇기 때문에 모티베이션의 원천은 취업이나 이직과 같은 외부 조건이 아니라, 성장이나 흥미와 같은 내재적인 부분에서 비롯되는 것이 훨씬 건강하다.</p>\n<p>물론 이런 내재적인 모티베이션도 번아웃과 같은 내부적 요인 때문에 무너질 수는 있지만, 적어도 목표를 달성하는 순간 내가 달릴 수 있는 원동력이 사라져버리는 상황보다는 훨씬 탄탄한 모티베이션이다.</p>\n<p>사실 이렇게 외부적인 모티베이션이나 내재적인 모티베이션에 대해 깊은 고민을 안 해본 사람이라고 해도, 본능적으로 어떤 것이 더 탄탄한 모티베이션인지는 누구나 다 알고 있다.</p>\n<p>여러분이 만약 면접관이라면 “왜 TIL을 쓰시는 거에요?”라는 질문에 “취업하기 위해서요”라고 말하는 사람에게 더 신뢰가 가겠는가, 아니면 “개발하는 것이 재미있어서요”, “제가 성장하기 위해서요”라고 말하는 사람에게 더 신뢰가 갈 것 같은가?</p>\n<p>전자의 답변같은 경우에는 당연히 “그럼 취업하면 안 하겠다는 건가?”라는 생각이 들 수 밖에 없는 답변이다. 그리고 이런 생각이 들게 만드는 것이 바로 외부적인 모티베이션이 주는 리스크인 것이다.</p>\n<p>물론 이런 예시와 함께 이야기하면 대부분 고개를 끄덕이며 공감하지만, 사실 우리는 모두 외부적인 모티베이션에 의존하는 삶에 굉장히 익숙하고, 이런 이야기를 하고 있는 필자 또한 나이가 점점 들면서 돈이라는 외부적인 모티베이션에 의존하는 경향이 강해지고 있다. <small><del>(집 값 너무 킹받는다…)</del></small></p>\n<p>결국 필자가 이 포스팅에서 이야기하고 싶은 것은 외부적인 모티베이션을 완전히 없애라는 것은 아니다. 이것은 불가능하기도 하고, 때로는 이러한 모티베이션이 더 뛰어난 모멘텀을 만들어 내기도 한다. 하지만 적어도 내가 현재 의존하고 있는 이 모티베이션이 앞으로도 지속 가능한 모티베이션인지, 정말로 나의 성장에 도움이 되는 모티베이션인지에 대한 고찰은 한번 쯤 해봐야 한다고 생각한다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"마치며\"

여러분의 진정한 적은 “다른 사람들은 열심히 하고 있는데, 나만 이런 고민하느라 시간을 낭비하는 게 아닐까?”, “내가 고민할 시간이 어딨어. 일단 뭐라도 해야지”라고 속삭이는 여러분 마음 속의 불안감이다.</p>\n<p>물론 상대적으로 일을 해온 경험이 부족한 개발자는 채용 시장에서 내세울 수 있는 무기가 그렇기 많지 않은 경우가 많다. 그래서 면접에서 조금이라도 더 좋은 모습을 보여주기 위해서 알고리즘 문제나 언어에 대한 이해와 같은 펀더멘탈에 집중하거나 1일 1커밋과 같이 당장 내가 실천할 수 있는 활동들에 집중하게 되는 것이다.</p>\n<p>물론 이런 펀더멘탈들을 공부하는 것은 개발자의 기본적인 소양이라고 할 수 있을만큼 중요하기도 하고, 1일 1커밋이나 TIL 같은 활동을 통해 성실함 같은 요소들을 어필할 수도 있겠지만, 중요한 것은 결과적으로 면접관이 찾는 사람이 단순히 이론에 빠삭하거나 성실하기만 한 사람이 아니라 “뭐가 됐든 일을 잘 할 수 있는 사람”이라는 사실이다.</p>\n<p>즉, 여러분은 채용 시장에서 눈에 띄는 인재가 되기 위한 전략이 필요한 것이고, 이 전략을 만드는 과정에서 “방향성이 명확한 노력”이 필요한 것이다.</p>\n<p>뭔가를 시작하기 전에 내가 이 노력을 통해서 뭘 원하는 지, 어떤 모습이 되고 싶은 지를 한번 머릿속에 그려보고 방향성을 수립한 후 실행하는 연습을 꾸준히 하다보면 언젠가는 여러분만의 노하우나 전략을 통해 시장에서 특별함을 뽐낼 수 있는 인재가 될 수 있을 것이라고 믿는다.</p>\n<p>이상으로 나만의 색깔을 찾는 방법 – 성장의
