(Seems like one spy snuck in but let's ignore it.)</small>\n</center>\n<p>So why did I write a book? Well, there are various reasons but narrowing down to a few, roughly this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to make tangible work that I can hold and see, not intangible work like code.</li>\n<li>While writing a book, couldn’t I organize knowledge I vaguely know?</li>\n<li>More people than expected were starting to learn coding through books.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I said I’m writing a book, some people occasionally cracked jokes like “Wow, Evan! Now you’ll make money from books too?” but I didn’t expect much because I thought from the start that money you can make selling books isn’t that much.</p>\n<p>Rather, for me the book’s appeal was less about side income and more about my own satisfaction of having written a book and being able to share what I know with others.</p>\n<p>It’s the same with this blog - honestly how much would I make from this blog? From the start my posts aren’t content the general public can consume. So even if the blog really takes off, making at most 1 million won per month would be a lot.</p>\n<p>Of course 1 million won isn’t small money, but it’s not life-changing money either so I think it’s meaningless. So I’m just running the blog wanting to share my thoughts and knowledge with others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wanting-to-make-tangible-work\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wanting to Make Tangible Work<a href=\"#wanting-to-make-tangible-work\" aria-label=\"wanting to make tangible work permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Being a developer, I make programs daily. But programs feel more abstract than like real existing objects. Like intangible conceptual things you can’t touch with hands or smell.</p>\n<p>But when I think of books, the image that immediately comes up is a synesthetic image with various senses together - paper smell when opening new books, texture felt when taking books from bookshelves, sounds heard when turning pages one by one - so it felt very different from making programs. That the output comes as shaped objects rather than mechanical something felt very new.</p>\n<p>And crucially, I’m a Kyobo Bookstore fanboy who went to Gwanghwamun Kyobo Bookstore extremely often holding Grandpa’s hand since age 5. Imagining my book displayed at Gwanghwamun Kyobo Bookstore with such memories felt somehow touching and strange.</p>\n<h3 id=\"organizing-my-knowledge-while-writing\" style=\"position:relative;\">Organizing My Knowledge While Writing<a href=\"#organizing-my-knowledge-while-writing\" aria-label=\"organizing my knowledge while writing permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Though I wrote a book about Vue, I obviously didn’t start writing knowing everything about Vue perfectly. Of course having 2 years’ experience using Vue makes me familiar, but being familiar doesn’t lead to being good.</p>\n<p>So I re-studied Vue from basics thinking I’m studying it again, re-reading from official docs. Looking closely, this is similar to blog posting - for example, if writing about Vue’s lifecycle, naturally most people research. Because I can’t be sure what I know is correct. In this sense, the burden felt from unspecified people reading my writing seems similar whether books or blogs.</p>\n<p>Plus, I actually never separately studied Vue. I just joined a company and that company had already adopted Vue, so I started using Vue, and after that I just looked up what I needed while developing business. <small>(So components I wrote early after joining are complete disasters.)</small></p>\n<p>For such reasons, I thought “since it came to this, let’s properly solidify my VueJS knowledge.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-people-than-expected-were-starting-coding-through-books\" style=\"position:relative;\">More People Than Expected Were Starting Coding Through Books<a href=\"#more-people-than-expected-were-starting-coding-through-books\" aria-label=\"more people than expected were starting coding through books permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, I’m someone who thinks “studying is more convenient with internet than books!” so I was skeptical about tech books. So when my friend first proposed co-authoring, writing the book itself felt somewhat meaningless and I said “who studies from books these days? Everyone searches on internet,” but that friend’s response was exactly this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dude, for people studying for the first time, it might even be hard to know what keywords to search for on the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hearing this, I immediately realized my thinking was quite short. Somewhere I read “humans unconsciously try to project themselves onto others,” and that was exactly me.</p>\n<p>Because I was always comfortable studying from internet, I naturally thought others would be too, but I forgot that basically studying from internet requires the premise of knowing what keywords to Google to get the information I want.</p>\n<p>Naturally, people first encountering development or unfamiliar with Googling can feel entry barriers in this regard, but I wasn’t thinking about that. So hearing that friend’s words, I thought:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might be better to build capability to Google alone after studying through books with relatively lower entry barriers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, obviously reading one book won’t suddenly make someone an absolute Vue master, but at least after reading the book and understanding overall content, I wanted to help readers gain ability to find keywords alone and Google and study more about what they want to know more.</p>\n<p>Besides these, there were other reasons like writing one more line on resumes or “being an author is kinda cool…?” plus altruistic reasons like “contributing a bit to developers’ ecosystem,” but the representative reasons greatly affecting my motivation were those three above. Ultimately after pondering, in late August 2018, I took my friend’s hand and entered the difficult path.</p>\n<h2 id=\"before-writing-the-book\" style=\"position:relative;\">Before Writing the Book<a href=\"#before-writing-the-book\" aria-label=\"before writing the book permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After co-authoring with my friend was decided, we first had a brief meeting with a publishing company employee at a cafe near Yeoksam Station. The content was roughly simple things like send us a writing plan, how royalties come out, how contracts will proceed.</p>\n<p>Until then my friend and I had only talked roughly about “we should write this and that content,” but now we had to discuss details to write the writing plan to send the publishing company. The key point among several things agreed then was “when readers finish this book, they should at least be able to develop applications when joining companies.”</p>\n<p>This came after reading several other Vue books currently on the market. Books being sold mainly explained APIs or technology principles focusing on that technology, and examples also tended to make simple To Do lists or small applications with similar architectures.</p>\n<p>The disappointing point my friend and I felt reading such books was “after reading this, can you work if immediately deployed to actual work?”</p>\n<p>No matter how much you learned through books what Vue APIs exist, what order lifecycle executes in, problems new developers face after joining companies aren’t simple problems like “which lifecycle should I put this logic in?” but higher-level problems like “what units should I divide components into?”, “Should API communication logic be in components? Or in Vuex store?”, “How should I manage logged-in user state?”</p>\n<p>So I thought it would be success just making readers think “Huh, I tried something similar to this once?” when encountering those problems at companies after writing this book’s examples once, and my friend thought identically, so deciding the book’s big direction wasn’t difficult.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 484px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/ff42b/plans.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 97.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"plans\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/ff42b/plans.png\" srcset=\"/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/69538/plans.png 160w,\n/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/72799/plans.png 320w,\n/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/ff42b/plans.png 484w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Scene reminding me of some meme seen somewhere</small>\n</center>\n<p>After the book’s big direction was decided, my friend and I definitely met once or twice weekly after work, went to nearby cafes, and started writing the writing plan together. The writing plan includes roughly this information:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Title (tentative)</li>\n<li>Author</li>\n<li>Writing date</li>\n<li>Book’s core concept</li>\n<li>Content summary and features</li>\n<li>Trends of technology related to this book</li>\n<li>Expected completion date</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are more pieces of information but the big framework is roughly this. Since the writing plan written then is also material the publishing company uses when promoting the book later, it’s good to write as detailed as possible.</p>\n<p>Anyway, after writing and submitting the writing plan as the publishing company requested, we started full-scale writing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-write-like-developers\" style=\"position:relative;\">Let’s Write Like Developers!<a href=\"#lets-write-like-developers\" aria-label=\"lets write like developers permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>At first we started writing using Google Docs. Google Docs provides font style features like H1, H2, so we could write documents setting styles agreed beforehand. But when we wrote about 3 chapters with Google Docs, I started thinking Google Docs was quite unproductive.</p>\n<p>When changing fonts or attaching images, having to position the cursor at the part to change then click menus with mouse felt too cumbersome, and concentration flow broke each time. Plus, having to set font styles to publishing company standards every time creating new documents for each chapter also lowered productivity.</p>\n<p>And my friend and I reviewed parts each other wrote by leaving comments on Google Docs documents to catch missed parts or unify writing style. However I thought this method was a bit unproductive - from the reviewer’s perspective it was hard to know what content was added this time, what content was deleted, and from the review receiver’s perspective it was hard to see at a glance where in the document comments were left.</p>\n<p>So I started pondering “how can I focus only on writing without spending time on actions other than writing?”</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-books-using-markdown\" style=\"position:relative;\">Writing Books Using Markdown<a href=\"#writing-books-using-markdown\" aria-label=\"writing books using markdown permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>What I chose as a result of my pondering was the Markdown format. Since both my friend and I are developers, first Markdown format was a very familiar format to us, and the document’s overall style was already decided, so it seemed I could keep focusing only on writing without worrying about style or doing separate work.</p>\n<p>But since publishing companies manage manuscripts using MS Word, ultimately when sending manuscripts to publishing companies we had to send docx files, and when receiving book reviews from other reviewers we had to send pdf files. So I had to find ways to convert Markdown files to docx or pdf files.</p>\n<p>So I found libraries called <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pandoc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">markdown-pdf</a>. <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code> supports converting various format documents enough to advertise on its homepage as Universal Document Converter. Of course it also supports converting Markdown to docx. But since it doesn’t support converting Markdown to pdf, I had to find other libraries to implement that feature, during which I found the <code class=\"language-text\">markdown-pdf</code> library.</p>\n<p>After finishing research up to here, I proposed to my friend to switch from Google Docs to Markdown, and my friend accepted after pondering, so after that all book writing proceeded using Markdown and Git.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-managing-documents-using-git\" style=\"position:relative;\">Version Managing Documents Using Git<a href=\"#version-managing-documents-using-git\" aria-label=\"version managing documents using git permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Another problem when using Google Docs was difficulty managing document versions. Of course Google Docs also lets you check content added or deleted in each version by entering the <code class=\"language-text\">File > Version history</code> menu, but the disadvantage is the version isn’t clearly what units they’re grouped by.</p>\n<p>But using Git, when committing you can divide into meaningful units and write accurate commit messages to inform the other person exactly which parts of the document were modified. Also, after writing certain units of documents, you can have the other person review through Pull Requests, ensuring at least one review of parts each wrote.</p>\n<p>So my friend and I created a repository on Github and proceeded with writing taking one chapter at a time, but agreed to always send Pull Requests and merge when wanting to merge content to master branch, and as a result we could proceed with writing without great difficulty understanding content even if not parts each wrote.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6569d/review.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 69.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"review\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6af66/review.png\" srcset=\"/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/69538/review.png 160w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/72799/review.png 320w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6af66/review.png 640w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/d9199/review.png 960w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/21b4d/review.png 1280w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6569d/review.png 1328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Benefits of reviewing.jpg</small>\n</center>\n<p>Of course, when doing full reviews later there were many parts to fix at once so we struggled a bit with Merge Conflicts, but if we’d proceeded with Google Docs, there was high possibility of passing without knowing where two people simultaneously modified.</p>\n<h3 id=\"converting-documents\" style=\"position:relative;\">Converting Documents<a href=\"#converting-documents\" aria-label=\"converting documents permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Documents written like this were partially published converted to PDF at intervals.

but later when converting to docx format through <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code>, issues related to font styles occurred.</p>\n<p>When converting to docx format using <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code>, you can set what’s called a reference document - if you set custom font styles in this document, it makes converted documents using the same font styles referring to this document’s font styles.</p>\n<p>So at first just trusting this feature I thought “I just need to make one reference document with font styles set according to publishing company format,” but when actually running scripts using the reference document option, code block styles attached to documents went haywire.</p>\n<p>So ultimately when finally sending manuscripts to the publishing company, I used the method of converting md format to docx format’s default font styles using <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code>, then manually changing that document’s font styles by hand.</p>\n<p>Well, I struggled quite a bit at the end, but still by choosing md format I could save lots of time during the writing process, plus I could version manage using Git, so overall I think it was a good choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conflicts-during-co-authoring\" style=\"position:relative;\">Conflicts During Co-authoring<a href=\"#conflicts-during-co-authoring\" aria-label=\"conflicts

But due to book media characteristics where unlike code it’s impossible to modify after deployment, the desire to “finish as perfectly as possible” made aligning opinions more difficult than usual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"different-perspectives-on-design\" style=\"position:relative;\">Different Perspectives on Design<a href=\"#different-perspectives-on-design\" aria-label=\"different perspectives on design permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>What caused many opinion conflicts initially was example application design. Since examples going into books are information exposed to unspecified people, they should be written using widely applicable knowledge excluding subjectivity as much as possible. So my friend and I talked tremendously about “how should we take example application design?”</p>\n<p>Simply from component naming and project directory structure to deep topics like which component should Dispatch actions for store state changes - we talked about various things. Ultimately only after drawing consensus through such endless communication could we enter example application development.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/077b7/meeting.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 79.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"meeting\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/6af66/meeting.png\" srcset=\"/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/69538/meeting.png 160w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/72799/meeting.png 320w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/6af66/meeting.png 640w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/d9199/meeting.png 960w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/077b7/meeting.png 1166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>We decided everything from Form component definition to what libraries to use.</small>\n</center>\n<h3 id=\"different-working-styles\" style=\"position:relative;\">Different Working Styles<a href=\"#different-working-styles\" aria-label=\"different working styles permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Second was working styles. Actually this was a really unexpected part - I already had experience proceeding with side projects with this friend, and even during opinion conflicts we came to very mutually satisfying conclusions proceeding, so I thought this time would be the same. But whether because this was paid work or had deadlines, situations very different from side projects unfolded.</p>\n<p>First, I’m not the style chased by deadlines doing any work. I can do this because I minimize variables arising during work and completely block work that seems risky. And crucially my personality is somewhat relaxed. To put it nicely relaxed, badly lazy - well anyway that kind of personality.</p>\n<p>But this friend has incredible passion whatever they do. Whether work they don’t want to do or want to do, always doing their best. I think this friend can do this because basically they have a personality with great sense of responsibility. <small>(Well might not be. Even friends have unknown parts)</small></p>\n<p>Exactly these parts about this friend greatly stimulate me, and even thinking developer to developer excluding the friend part, I think they’re a very good developer.</p>\n<p>But doing work with deadlines together, from this friend’s perspective it seemed I wasn’t actively participating, and I had thoughts like “this isn’t work to stress this much about…” And being human, as deadlines approached we inevitably felt anxiety like “what if we can’t keep promises with the publishing company,” and both working at companies had to do company work separately. So I think physical and mental fatigue accumulated.</p>\n<p>Still fortunately, the biggest commonality between this friend and me was knowing the importance of soft skills like communication. So even stressed chased by deadlines, we could finish writing without major conflict by maximally considering each other and listening and exchanging opinions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reviewing-the-book\" style=\"position:relative;\">Reviewing the Book<a href=\"#reviewing-the-book\" aria-label=\"reviewing the book permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>While writing the book my friend and I kept reviewing using Pull Requests, but reviews from author perspectives are mainly mechanical reviews like typo correction, writing style unification, while reviews from other reviewers are qualitative reviews hard to notice from author’s perspective like “is this content really helpful?”, “would be better with this content.” So we wanted to collect as much feedback as possible from reviewers during or after writing.</p>\n<p>Actually I don’t have many developer connections and don’t like meeting people, so I didn’t have many people to ask reviews besides workplace colleagues. But my friend had richer connections and better social skills than me, so had many people to ask reviews. <small>(Amazing…)</small> For such reasons, book reviews were work I couldn’t do alone and really thanks to my friend.

So at first I pondered tremendously about “what should I do for study members…?” but once the study started I knew such worry was my groundless fear.</p>\n<p>All study applicants passionately asked questions first and clearly expressed opinions about parts wanting to know more, so I could proceed with the study comfortably. And everyone had good personalities so even shy me could fit in well.</p>\n<p>While writing the book, receiving feedback from study members who were actual target readers and modifying the book somehow gave me confidence about the book, and seeing them learn smoothly studying with the book I wrote, I felt somewhat proud.</p>\n<p>Actually I didn’t have desire to proactively share knowledge with others first, but writing books this time and running studies, seeing knowledge I thought was nothing much greatly helping others, I became a bit interested in education and my shyness improved a bit. <small>(Still the path to social butterfly is long and tough…)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"working-developers-reviews\" style=\"position:relative;\">Working Developers’ Reviews<a href=\"#working-developers-reviews\" aria-label=\"working developers reviews permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>After finishing writing the book, I also asked surrounding working developers for reviews - such people are called beta readers apparently.

I hope many prospective readers reading this book feel it was beneficial. Especially I hope people starting frontend development for the first time read this book and think “Huh what, it’s not much?”</p>\n<p>And finally, I want to give <strong>overwhelming thanks</strong> to beta readers who spared busy personal time reviewing the book and developer Kim Younghoon who proposed the good opportunity of technical book writing.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/4b190/thanks.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 86.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAARABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBAwX/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFtswTKxRyQpB//xAAeEAACAgAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADBBESEzEyM//aAAgBAQABBQIVFpUldj6QGXhSFbZGZmI9E6//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/AR//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/AR//xAAeEAACAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAxESEDECKBof/aAAgBAQAGPwJnY4UGeNCwYwrcbjKnA+zQ2YTmzDE99f/EAB0QAAMAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESExEHFRgbH/2gAIAQEAAT8hyA5S4ZvuPgSOeGnpF7nHWhKs6BUT2h8OG1n/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEBMPAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQMBAT8QH//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQIBAT8QH//EAB0QAQEAAwACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExYfAQceH/2gAIAQEAAT8QNdEUtY7mbrYqXbUJ5xNgnKwwIEwQz1dAt/MCsCFCQliW4ZAU7NWa74zj278B7PrP/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"thanks\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/c08c5/thanks.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/0913d/thanks.jpg 160w,\n/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/cb69c/thanks.jpg 320w,\n/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/c08c5/thanks.jpg 640w,\n/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/4b190/thanks.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>By the way, my book can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/76639545\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yes24</a>, but since first edition printing hasn’t finished yet, delivery is possible from next month.</p>\n<p>But rather than buying books online, I want to recommend going to offline bookstores like Kyobo Bookstore when the book stocks later, reading once, and buying.

Service Worker is a process that runs in the background after installing in the browser, operating completely separately from web application’s main logic.</p>\n<p>Service Worker and webapp’s main logic operate by exchanging messages. Send with <code class=\"language-text\">postMessage</code>, receive with <code class=\"language-text\">onMessage</code> - same method as WebView or Chrome Extension, so already familiar to us.</p>\n<p>However, since not yet supported in all browsers, you must check if <code class=\"language-text\">serviceWorker</code> object exists inside <code class=\"language-text\">navigator</code> global object before proceeding with initialization.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'serviceWorker'</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> navigator<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* ... */</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Well, this level is so familiar to frontend developers like me we can just laugh it off, but something more annoying existed.

My company uses origin <code class=\"language-text\">http://local.soomgo.com</code> locally, so Service Worker object isn’t activated.</p>\n<p>Then solutions narrow to two. I access localhost or attach HTTPS locally.</p>\n<p>Actually I missed this and wasted about 30 minutes arguing with my computer like “ah where’s Service Worker? Why not working?

Of course, since this key doesn’t actually authenticate anything important but only uses it in local dev server, there’s no worry of important things getting stolen, but habits matter.

If Service Worker installation failed, it should show where error occurred, why it occurred, but just shows one <code class=\"language-text\">Uncaught DomException</code> and ends.</p>\n<p>So you must mark <code class=\"language-text\">debugger</code> on each code line and infer and fix what went wrong - this is really hard. But they brazenly wrote debugging is hard on official docs, which somehow makes it feel harder.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 436px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e57b6ba2e83f7ede90d76af1007b9b33/8574c/conan.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100.62500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAFVklEQVR42i2UW1CU5x3Gv/f9vt1lgbAgsMuyCLscdlGWwy4LLEcBcSEuEBUVMBBMPFAVNRqPoxFzUoxTT9EiMbUaiHaSeiCotUkm6UzbybTptE7bTA9pvelMbtppe5Gr3vz6r+3Ff77v5v19z/v9n+cxdIoX7fSj00MoVzUqqw6V3YJyJ7Dy+8jy9+AtSZAflPfyMczQIYzyE6jwKYyqc6jIJXT0Mrr2Cjr+PQyVHkRnVGJkxbDlxnHkdWJ4n8HKS7C4IERlwMdSn5uKAjc1xT4qK9vIr9lOfmSCRTWHBDSNis9ha54jreM9DJ0ZxcxuwhBF9uwYmTklmL4B7I5FpJiavOwsij0eCnNyCRcVUOP3koj6idUlcda/ha3xHVLbv09Gxw18KwWoctvRnh60dzXKuwbLFcSe6sZm2jC1nXSnU4Bu/Lm5lHk9REsD9NRXsyxcREnTLtJX3MHTPcfyHfe5vPAXUejtRxcMoorG0IGtmIWj2Jx52LSJ3XSgDBNPVibVpX5yMzJorQoysaaNxoYERUt7iW+8zdR7X/KTP/yLS/N/FIUCUAJSpbvRwX2YFW9gebqwGQapKWmERVG0rIhnWmNkP5VOQ7yFgzvGCcWG+daxOT5+9DU3f/w1yRfvkdl6UYClO1Ghg+glk+jwFKrmMvaKVzAMG7HyAKP9XSxPJDl3fB9b+xp5d2o/81ffYvb+Fzz41d8ZmfyUvK4rOOrOYK+dEqCAVOUUuvoCKjqDWX8do+4Wfat3cn5nko+mD/PJjQv89tZpHt86zu9n9zJ7bY4907+juP86joYLOKKnhSEiQvsFWHUWHZlBx66hGm6iW97HWLZA7fpZLh8e5+G53Xx+5SUe357kr/OTzJ1/k/KBm6TEp7HFzmCLnEBXHJVbvogu3iJLqb0qPrqBav4Ae8ddXD33yEl+SO7K2zQOTtPcMczmoVXMHnmO60e24V1+Eav+O9ijp9CiSoUOoEu3o/xjqIK1orDpfWztd3iqe4Hs5D3cyXkat37C0ZlfEl6+k4H+AX50fhcTyxoYro+TVbUNIyyqlh5Gl8kiA5vRhUNoSZVyd2GkJxbI6b2Pu/dDqkYfcmDmEZ8//jeTlx7Q3T3AByfHuXpwkJMTQ7x0+BjNnYN4JSVGYBxdNIL2rUHliY9z2tCLYhKQ3nuUDz9k+9lf89Fv/inzDzaeekR85SH5d3v56gev8OqmJHfeeJ6FM7t5cHEfvX2b5eBaLG8vpgTDXBRHZ1ZjZpRjjLz+c+Z/8Td++qdvOPj2lwTX3cWIXmVs08t8MTPO3RMv8O2JNewfW8uKFeuINA8JqA9DvKolsjorIqAKKZdidNpijJ999Q2nbv6ZqpEf4mx9F3vTFVTsEq66E4wPb2Dr6qdJJAYINW9kSeMwodo+nPntqMxatCssoDIBFUpj5aMdbozW7Z+RJuE2G6/J9qSGImfE4K9hBA9hL53AVbgMf00/JZF+AhUd1LQN4w52Y6SWYaaJKqdPQB5Mew6mlYFhNc9KY3wXM3pBbHASteRl2d4e2d4WHIH1LGnaQHXnJlE3QmXTEA1dz1MQ7sVI8WE6PVj2bCybC9NMRUv2DVV7EV11WmxwDCVZ1sXbnhSEkbeKjMDTRNpHCTaNUBp/lpbujRw4cpZgTY8cdGGzu7Asp8AcMvYnY+iK19HSwrpkxxNz6oL14qmkFG4rJdVJ+ga3sGrDXjpX76Gl5znePDdLXb34zdACTJVrCsyyY2mpO2XJh/5rTv8m9OIhlIB0bqcUbhwlLZ7pi9Kzch3HXz3PkaOn2fXCKE0Nbdgc6f9TJDBLnpaAzP/PfwDrN8WrTqXoQAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"conan\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e57b6ba2e83f7ede90d76af1007b9b33/8574c/conan.png\" srcset=\"/static/e57b6ba2e83f7ede90d76af1007b9b33/69538/conan.png 160w,\n/static/e57b6ba2e83f7ede90d76af1007b9b33/72799/conan.png 320w,\n/static/e57b6ba2e83f7ede90d76af1007b9b33/8574c/conan.png 436w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Help me detective... find not just culprits but my bugs too...</small>\n</center>\n<h2 id=\"third-gateway-pushmanager\" style=\"position:relative;\">Third Gateway, PushManager<a href=\"#third-gateway-pushmanager\" aria-label=\"third gateway pushmanager permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Now that Service Worker is installed, connecting Service Worker’s <code class=\"language-text\">PushManager</code> finishes everything!

At first I regretted “should’ve just used Nuxt…” but thanks to that I think it was a good opportunity to learn more deeply about Universal SSR’s execution process. <small><del>(wrapping grunt work like this)</del></small></p>\n<p>In this post I want to describe in detail down to the function level about the initialization process of the SSR application I wrote. First, the application’s rendering process is as follows. I’ll describe each process in detail afterward.</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Client requests resources from server</li>\n<li>nginx serves requests to port where Express is running</li>\n<li>Express routing starts</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">server-entry.js</code> executes</li>\n<li>Server’s <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> routing proceeds</li>\n<li>Render HTML using vue-server-renderer</li>\n<li>Server responds to client</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">client-entry.js</code> executes</li>\n<li>Client application initialization function executes</li>\n<li>Client’s <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> routing proceeds</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">app.$mount</code></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Excluding request #1 and response #7, steps <code class=\"language-text\">2-6</code> are processes happening on the server and steps <code class=\"language-text\">8-10</code> are processes happening on the client. What’s peculiar is that server and client have different entry points.</p>\n<p>And as I’ll explain later, these entry points share and use several same functions. Functions like <code class=\"language-text\">router.onReady</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">createApp</code> are like that. Originally Universal SSR is basically the concept of “let’s server-side render just the first request and afterward operate like an SPA. And let’s make code reusable on server and client.” So there are convenient aspects, but since execution timing or environment can be completely different even for the same function, there were many confusing parts like needing to do separate exception handling.</p>\n<p>And when these two entry points execute on server and client, they go through different initialization processes. If you initialize on the server then initialize everything from scratch again on the client, it’s inefficient, so it uses several methods to perform rendering as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Let’s first look at server-side rendering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-side-rendering\" style=\"position:relative;\">Server Side Rendering<a href=\"#server-side-rendering\" aria-label=\"server side rendering permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"client-requests-resources-from-server\" style=\"position:relative;\">Client Requests Resources from Server<a href=\"#client-requests-resources-from-server\" aria-label=\"client requests resources from server permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The client sends a request to the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nginx-serves-requests-to-port-where-express-is-running\" style=\"position:relative;\">nginx Serves Requests to Port Where Express Is Running<a href=\"#nginx-serves-requests-to-port-where-express-is-running\" aria-label=\"nginx serves requests to port where express is running permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Usually when developing servers using nodeJS, directly launching servers with commands like <code class=\"language-text\">node server.js</code> is rare.

I used Express, I naturally used Express’s router. But since Vue proceeds with actual routing, in Express you use wildcards like <code class=\"language-text\">app.get('*')</code> to execute callback functions for all requests.</p>\n<p>Looking in the middle, there’s also code like <code class=\"language-text\">app.get('/ping')</code> - that’s a router written separately because of AWS Elastic Beanstalk’s Health Check. ELB periodically pings specific URLs of instances belonging to that environment to check if the current environment is operating properly. This URL can be changed in ELB settings, and I set it as the URL <code class=\"language-text\">/ping</code>.</p>\n<p>The reason for separating this router separately is because the more <code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code>’s render function executes, the more HTML templates go up in memory, and thereby bottlenecks occur in the render process, so I set it to send a simple page as a response with just Express without executing <code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code>.</p>\n<p>Express routing and <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> routing I’ll explain below can be confusing. As I just explained, actual routing proceeds in Vue, but Express receives and processes requests first then passes them to Vue, so routing must be done in Express too. After routing, when the <code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code> method on the last line executes, routing and rendering proceeding in Vue start.</p>\n<p>Now I’ll explain the inside of the <code class=\"language-text\">app.get('*')</code> router in detail.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-js

most important part in this routing is the role of the <code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code> method.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code> has 2 render functions: <code class=\"language-text\">renderToString</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code>.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">renderToString</code> returns rendered HTML in string form when all rendering finishes, then afterward returns HTML to the client at once. Therefore, if render speed takes long, users have no choice but to look at a blank screen. Also, since it sends data at once, it has the disadvantage of having to put all content in memory when proceeding with HTML rendering. If HTML size is small it’s not a problem, but the larger the file size, the more memory space each rendering eats up.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">renderToStream</code> returns a nodeJS <code class=\"language-text\">ReadableStream</code> object whenever one event finishes. <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stream</a> is a nodeJS feature that can load data in certain chunk units and manage streams with event callback calls using the <code class=\"language-text\">on</code> method. The data event is called whenever each chunk becomes <code class=\"language-text\">readable</code> state, and if all data is loaded, the <code class=\"language-text\">end</code> event is called.

But there’s one problem using this logic as is on the server.</p>\n<p>The problem occurs when returning data types using Call by Reference evaluation strategy with <code class=\"language-text\">export default</code>. Since <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> called in <code class=\"language-text\">new Vue()</code> operates like a class returning instances, this code ultimately returns the memory address where the <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instance went up. This logic has no particular problems on clients, but problems can occur on servers.</p>\n<p>Unlike clients, servers are programs that, once up, keep running for a long time. Since users currently accessing the server shouldn’t share <code class=\"language-text\">Store</code> state, servers must create new <code class=\"language-text\">Store</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instances for each request.</p>\n<p>But what’s <code class=\"language-text\">export</code>ed in the above code is ultimately the <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instance’s memory pointer, and when this module is <code class=\"language-text\">import</code>ed, this module creates a <code class=\"language-text\">Vue</code> instance just once at first, then afterward returns the memory pointer to reference - that is, <strong>the same instance</strong>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, during server-side rendering, to avoid state pollution, you must write it by exposing factory functions instead of instance memory pointers and creating and returning new instances every time.</p>\n<p>I missed this fact and created a bug where users shared sessions inside <code class=\"language-text\">Store</code>, so logging in with my account logged in as someone else’s account. It’s a dizzying moment even thinking about it now.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Node.js server is a long-running process. When our code is required into the process, it will be evaluated once and stays in memory.\n…\nSo, instead of directly creating an app instance, we should expose a factory function that can be repeatedly executed to create fresh app instances for each request.</p>\n<p><strong>Vue SSR Guide</strong> <em>Avoid Stateful Singletons</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even written blatantly like this in the <a href=\"https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/structure.html#avoid-stateful-singletons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">official documentation</a>, I missed it and created a huge bug. We must read official documentation!

Why must we necessarily store authenticated tokens in Store? First, since this server is a render server that only performs rendering, session validity checks must communicate with external API servers to perform.</p>\n<p>Authentication state may be needed on the server and may also be needed on the client. Then you must communicate once on the server to check tokens and also communicate on the client to check tokens. But since this method is inefficient, frameworks supporting universal SSR like this usually use the method of serializing server state into the <code class=\"language-text\">window</code> object and declaring it inside <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;script></code> tags during rendering to return server state to clients.</p>\n<p>In <code class=\"language-text\">vue-server-renderer</code>, server state to return to clients is declared using <a href=\"https://vuex.vuejs.org/kr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vuex</a>, Vue’s <a href=\"https://haruair.github.io/flux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flux architecture</a> library.</p>\n<p>Thus server state gets serialized using <code class=\"language-text\">JSON.stringify</code> during rendering and contained in the property <code class=\"language-text\">window.__INITIAL_STATE__</code>, and afterward during client initialization, it accesses that property, uses <code class=\"language-text\">JSON.parse</code> to convert to Object type, then uses Vuex Store’s <code class=\"language-text\">replaceState</code> method to update Store.</p>\n<center>\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/37523/initial_state.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 38.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAABIElEQVR42p2Sy26DMBBF8yVdYBuS8jABTACpQFQUIAQ23fT/f+TUYVFVeVRVF0cjeaTjO2NvYt8n0xH5fk8ShRyShLei4Nx11EVOFgmWk6ZvAppiZ6vPqfaJdhJPOGxv2Ggds7cSk+drzYwhzQxllfM+fpLmbzjOC1IJPE/hWjzPxXUlQt6zcd1r8wfKxdt6lGnBWH5QmoamrWmbllc7jeMIpJBI+ZiNEIJbpJKYKKeLOruOlMs8sywLQRBYofNUtgrvDu3tylVWaBiTiT4ZKdKSYRwYhgGt9a/Sp8I0yjjFPY1uOR6PTNNEVVUopf6XMNeHVWhiw/lyZr7MhGH4nW5dzZ+E8iqUpGFGHbVkvqFuaoZ+wNgfsPZtyusDPkr7BYT48n0a47z1AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"initial state\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/6af66/initial_state.png\" srcset=\"/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/69538/initial_state.png 160w,\n/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/72799/initial_state.png 320w,\n/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/6af66/initial_state.png 640w,\n/static/e35fb3b389f37a4a3a71e3a947ff18a5/37523/initial_state.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <small>You can check it like this in browser console</small>\n</center>\n<h3 id=\"servers-code-classlanguage-textvue-routercode-routing-proceeds\" style=\"position:relative;\">Server’s <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> Routing Proceeds<a href=\"#servers-code-classlanguage-textvue-routercode-routing-proceeds\" aria-label=\"servers code classlanguage textvue routercode routing proceeds permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Let’s look at routing logic that was #2. Universal SSR applications proceed with routing on the server side the very first time users open pages, and afterward when users move pages, routing proceeds on the client.</p>\n<p>In other words, routing logic inside <code class=\"language-text\">server-entry.js</code> is logic that executes exactly once when users initially execute the application for the very first time. Since I wrote router authentication-related logic on the client, only checking whether components are connected to this router on the server, I wrote server-side entry routing logic simply.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">router</code> object used in this file is an instance of the <code class=\"language-text\">VueRouter</code> class in the <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code> library created and returned by the <code class=\"language-text\">createApp</code> factory function. I decided to just check whether the current route is a valid route using this class’s <code class=\"language-text\">getMatchedComponents</code> method.</p>\n<p>The meaning of <code class=\"language-text\">VueRouter</code>’s member variables and methods is also in <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code>’s <a href=\"https://router.vuejs.org/kr/api/#router-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">official documentation</a>, but sometimes libraries are updated but official documentation updates are late, so I directly looked at <code class=\"language-text\">vue-router</code>’s code.</p>\n<p>Looking at the <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules/vue-router/types/router.d.ts</code> file, you can confirm the <code class=\"language-text\">VueRouter</code> class’s member variables and methods.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\"

it’s current workplace code, I couldn’t write everything, but the logic the <code class=\"language-text\">init</code> function performs is reflecting server store state to client and user authentication processing. Since the principle of receiving server store state was explained in <a href=\"/2018/09/25/vue-ssr/#code-classlanguage-textserver-entryjscode-execution\">server-entry.js execution</a>, this time I’ll try explaining “why process login on client instead of server.”</p>\n<p>The reason is because this server is a render server without separate authentication logic, so tasks like getting user information or checking authentication depend entirely on external API servers. Initially I overlooked this fact and chose the method of communicating with APIs during server rendering then sending user data down to clients, but the following problems occurred:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>API communication time was included in HTML template render time. <small>(Since server rendering’s lifecycle also ends when rendering finishes, you have no choice but to synchronously process API communication using the <code class=\"language-text\">await</code> keyword during rendering. Even the authenticated user information GET API is quite slow)</small></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">vue-ssr-renderer</code>’s <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> method’s execution time increased.</li>\n<li>As <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> method’s execution time increased, more templates went up in memory at once.</li>\n<li>Memory fills up and can no longer perform rendering.</li>\n<li>Server cannot respond.</li>\n<li>Fail</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>So the part I focused on most when building this render server was shortening the <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> method’s execution time, and as a result, logic fetching user data went down to the client. Thinking about it later, views needing currently authenticated user data are parts not needing SEO, so there was no need to do it on the server. Now let’s finally look at client routing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clients-code-classlanguage-textvue-routercode-routing-proceeds\" style=\"position:relative;\">Client’s <code

the router part isn’t much different from the routing logic part in <code class=\"language-text\">sever-entry.js</code>. But one difference is that <code class=\"language-text\">client-entry.js</code>’s routing has logic comparing the current router’s components with the previous router’s components.</p>\n<p>Unlike server rendering where routing happens just once during the first request, client routing happens multiple times according to user actions. Client rendering only newly renders parts where components changed when the router changes and keeps the rest as is, so the next router may be using components that were in the current router as is.</p>\n<p>The important point is that on the client too, <code class=\"language-text\">asyncData</code> is being used to <code class=\"language-text\">fetch</code> data before routing completes, just like on the server.</p>\n<p>In other words, if a component existing in the current router also exists in the next router, there’s no need to perform duplicate logic in that component’s <code class=\"language-text\">asyncData</code>, so logic must be written to perform logic comparing components when the router changes, then only perform <code class=\"language-text\">asyncData</code> of changed components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"appmount---rendering-ends-vue-lifecycle-starts\" style=\"position:relative;\">app.$mount -> Rendering Ends.
