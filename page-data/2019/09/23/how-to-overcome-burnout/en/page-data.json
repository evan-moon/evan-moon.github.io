It’s a condition that even the WHO took seriously enough to officially register in ICD-11 in May 2019. The WHO says burnout isn’t classified as a medical disease, but rather as an occupational phenomenon.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>Burnout is often described as “being completely burned out with nothing left but ashes.” When I first experienced it, that metaphor felt exactly right. This is something many people go through — the word “burnout” has become so commonplace that you hear it in everyday conversation.</p>\n<p>What made my experience especially difficult was that it seemed to arrive without warning. One day I was enjoying coding, and the next morning I just… wasn’t. It was deeply unsettling.</p>\n<p>Of course, burnout doesn’t actually appear overnight. It must have been building up gradually until some small trigger set it all off. Thoughts like “this is just what being an employee is like,” “the team is short-staffed so I have no choice,” and “if I don’t study on weekends, I’ll fall behind” — I’d been whipping myself with these every day, working overtime, pushing harder. It all accumulated until it couldn’t be contained anymore, and came back as one massive explosion.</p>\n<p>So in this post, I want to reflect on what I felt during my burnout and how I dealt with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"burnout-came-out-of-nowhere\" style=\"position:relative;\">Burnout Came Out of Nowhere<a href=\"#burnout-came-out-of-nowhere\" aria-label=\"burnout came out of nowhere permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As I mentioned, burnout seemed to hit me suddenly. It was the result of accumulated stress and pressure, but since I’d been accepting all of it as “just part of the job,” the shock was no less real.</p>\n<p>The reason I first got into coding was simple — building things was genuinely fun, and being able to bring my ideas to life through code felt almost magical. I even formed a team called Rubicon with friends, and we’d build all sorts of projects together. During that time, we’d meet every day — weekdays, weekends, it didn’t matter — to discuss ideas and create new things. I was completely absorbed in the joy of it.</p>\n<p>After graduating and working as a professional developer, I maintained this lifestyle for a few years. But as time went on, my patterns started to unravel.</p>\n<p>Working until 11 PM was routine, but I’d still feel like the day was wasted if I went to bed then, so I’d code until 2-3 AM every night. On weekends, feeling like I needed to make up for lost time, I’d code from morning to night.</p>\n<p>Then one day, sitting in the office coding as usual, a thought suddenly hit me:</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/faa85dd77cfe0a3934dc3dd5cc69930f/eea4a/no-jam.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"no jam\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/faa85dd77cfe0a3934dc3dd5cc69930f/c08c5/no-jam.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/faa85dd77cfe0a3934dc3dd5cc69930f/0913d/no-jam.jpg 160w,\n/static/faa85dd77cfe0a3934dc3dd5cc69930f/cb69c/no-jam.jpg 320w,\n/static/faa85dd77cfe0a3934dc3dd5cc69930f/c08c5/no-jam.jpg 640w,\n/static/faa85dd77cfe0a3934dc3dd5cc69930f/6a068/no-jam.jpg 960w,\n/static/faa85dd77cfe0a3934dc3dd5cc69930f/eea4a/no-jam.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This isn't fun anymore...</small>\n</center>\n<p>I’d hit a wall — coding had become boring. At first, I thought it was because I’d been using the same framework (Vue) every day, so I switched to the mobile team that was using React Native. But the excitement of a new framework and development environment only lasted about a week. Once it became familiar, the same feeling of tedium returned.</p>\n<p>This was something I’d started because I loved it, and the sudden loss of interest was a completely new experience for me. I had no idea how to cope. I still had to show up and do the same work tomorrow, and if my productivity dropped, it would affect the whole team.</p>\n<p>On top of that, I was afraid to tell my teammates — worried that my negativity might drag down the team’s morale. I kept it bottled up. When I occasionally mentioned it to friends, the responses were typically “that’s just what working life is like” or “take a break.”</p>\n<p>Since I was employed, I couldn’t just take an indefinite break. And no matter how much I rested on weekends, the tedium came right back on Monday. So I resigned myself to the idea that this is just how working life feels.</p>\n<p>What I didn’t anticipate was that the burnout would get worse. Without proper intervention, the tedium deepened, and eventually I told my team lead that I wanted to quit.</p>\n<p>At that point, my emotions were a complex mix: fatigue from the daily grind, guilt about being a burden to my teammates, and disappointment in myself for losing my love of coding.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been impatient by nature, and I’d lived my life constantly driving myself harder. So my conclusion about the burnout was characteristically hasty: “It’s not getting better as fast as I expected — I should just quit before I drag the team down further.”</p>\n<p>But my team lead told me something that changed my perspective: burnout isn’t an individual problem — it’s a team problem. He encouraged me to share what I was going through with the team anytime. That single statement meant more to me than he probably realized. It gave me just enough breathing room to start thinking differently.</p>\n<p>From that point on, I began thinking less about code and more about myself — which led me to rediscover things I’d been overlooking for a long time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"something-i-never-experienced-before-becoming-a-developer\" style=\"position:relative;\">Something I Never Experienced Before Becoming a Developer<a href=\"#something-i-never-experienced-before-becoming-a-developer\" aria-label=\"something i never experienced before becoming a developer permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Once I started seriously reflecting on myself to overcome burnout, the thing that puzzled me most was this: I had never experienced anything like this before becoming a developer.</p>\n<p>You might think that’s obvious since I was a student before, but from 2004 to 2011, I was actually a b-boy on a professional crew.

When these desires work in a healthy way, they can be a driving force for growth. But in my case, they’d gone too far.</p>\n<p>After a long period of reflection, my conclusion was simple: “I’ve been whipping myself too hard.” No one outside was pressuring me.

I figured some distance from coding was exactly what I needed.</p>\n<p>This daily coding habit started in college. At first it was natural — I coded every day because I genuinely loved it. But at some point, it became half habit, half compulsive obligation.</p>\n<p>Looking at the brilliant developers around me only amplified the pressure. I thought that if I slacked on learning new technologies and paradigms, I’d be left behind in this industry. So I kept reading tech posts and building projects with new tools.</p>\n<p>In reality, no matter how much I studied, every technology has a learning curve, and keeping up with all of them is impossible. By the time you get comfortable with technology A, technology B with an entirely new paradigm has already emerged — that’s just how the IT industry works. I was essentially stressing over an impossible goal.</p>\n<p>But when I thought about it more carefully, I realized I had plenty of unique strengths. Having dabbled in so many things over the years, I had knowledge in areas like WebGL, astrophysics, and sound engineering that most web developers don’t know or care about. <small>(A jack-of-all-trades, if you will.)</small></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/13c73e3939d36c2cafd64df245bf3e00/a8417/my-projects.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 46.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAJCAYAAAAywQxIAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABNUlEQVR42mVS2W7DMAzL///jXrp1aBvk8iHJR8zJTrM2qQDCh2SZpN3Ni8VoI5wUlIITSsO6rggxYeEMCprAsSaECGaBhIDOWIfLfcG1tzDGwjoP7wlEhD3qIad7197hMXswMbzmvfftsj3qvLOaJHIQYaSU2mbDk92OnDyEPEprsNE717SGTQplSCoHRuV5oCJroYQEwyusWmNFR5W/rq+aVpczutk4fF0H9KNtMpxKrkzfoza3zuJym/D9MJhc9XNtHr5HY0gS1NDqRX7S3tid2ebECEKIQXSeDlIPkj0JfoYKxm0SRLUgpg319XLePHU+4DZH/E4Bo9N9JVBz77+irjtWhtYzFkcwiiqbRUDM2uQlv77+vR8UYxuHcWqXf0iuUpjpIPMcNZOi//8mu8SPulLwBzaWwkSIR6mPAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"my projects\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/13c73e3939d36c2cafd64df245bf3e00/6af66/my-projects.png\" srcset=\"/static/13c73e3939d36c2cafd64df245bf3e00/69538/my-projects.png 160w,\n/static/13c73e3939d36c2cafd64df245bf3e00/72799/my-projects.png 320w,\n/static/13c73e3939d36c2cafd64df245bf3e00/6af66/my-projects.png 640w,\n/static/13c73e3939d36c2cafd64df245bf3e00/a8417/my-projects.png 941w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Thanks to some active self-promotion, kind souls occasionally star my repositories.</small>\n</center>\n<p>These skills aren’t particularly useful for building typical applications, but when a niche role comes up that requires them, I can at least throw my hat in the ring. <small>(And niche expertise tends to pay well.)</small></p>\n<p>I started thinking of these as my unique weapons — what differentiated me from other developers.

Salary is largely determined through negotiation, and effective negotiation isn’t just about talking well — it requires sustained self-advocacy within the organization, peer evaluations, demonstrated skill, and frankly, a bit of luck.</p>\n<p>Like being the last frontend developer standing after everyone else leaves — that’s the kind of fortunate situation that gives you leverage at the negotiation table.</p>\n<p>Without much work experience, I couldn’t have known any of this, and naturally I kept drifting further from my unrealistic target.

By any reasonable standard, it was enough for a 29-year-old to live on his own.</p>\n<p>But human nature is fickle — even when you know you earn enough to live comfortably, seeing someone earn more than you inevitably sparks envy. The allure of money is powerful that way.</p>\n<p>This led me to question whether salary was really that important. My conclusion was: no matter how much I earn, it’ll never feel like enough. When I told friends this, some asked if I’d become a monk.

The relentless self-discipline did help me grow quickly in a short time, but looking back, I wonder if it was really worth it.</p>\n<p>These days, I don’t follow trends much. I study things when I need to or when I’m curious — so I’m definitely slower at picking up new tech than I used to be. I didn’t even hear about Kubernetes until well after everyone else had started using it, because a friend happened to mention it.</p>\n<p>But I can at least say that I’m happier doing development now than I was before.</p>\n<p>The reason I started coding in the first place was simply because it was fun.

The courage to make that leap — accepting a month-long gap and the not-insignificant costs for someone between jobs — was something that grew directly out of this burnout experience.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/93dbfc8132467f7fd3125876f3e88e7e/acb04/locco.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"locco\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/93dbfc8132467f7fd3125876f3e88e7e/c08c5/locco.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/93dbfc8132467f7fd3125876f3e88e7e/0913d/locco.jpg 160w,\n/static/93dbfc8132467f7fd3125876f3e88e7e/cb69c/locco.jpg 320w,\n/static/93dbfc8132467f7fd3125876f3e88e7e/c08c5/locco.jpg 640w,\n/static/93dbfc8132467f7fd3125876f3e88e7e/acb04/locco.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    A lovely café that doubles as a coworking space.<br>\n    Highly recommended for anyone digital nomading in Prague.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried before coming to Prague, but with nothing to lose as someone between jobs, I just went for it.

A라는 기술이 새로 나와서 그 기술을 공부하다가 어느 정도 이해가 될 때 쯤에는 새로운 패러다임을 가진 B라는 기술이 나오는 것이 IT업계의 현실이니 말이다. 결국 필자는 불가능한 목표에 압박을 느끼고 목을 메고 있던 것이다.</p>\n<p>그러나 곰곰히 생각해보니 필자는 다른 장점이 많은 사람이었다. 예전부터 워낙 이것저것 해왔다 보니까 WebGL이나 천체물리학, 사운드 엔지니어링 등 일반적인 웹 개발자들은 잘 모르고 관심도 없는 분야에 대한 어느 정도 지식이 있었기 때문이다. <small>(일종의 잡캐라고 할 수 있다)</small></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;
