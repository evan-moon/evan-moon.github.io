When feedback given out of genuine desire for each other’s development works healthily, it can raise the quality of members’ learning to high levels.</p>\n<p>I have good memories of exchanging such feedback with teammates at my previous job, advising each other and sharing books or articles. In fact, one of my criteria for choosing my workplace during this job change was determined through such feedback.</p>\n<p>So is “honesty” really all that’s needed to create this healthy feedback culture?</p>\n<p>However, I personally think applying this feedback-giving culture to reality by looking only at the keyword “honesty” is a bit ambiguous. Not impossible, but there are several obstacles to overcome before such a culture successfully settles into an organization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"people-cant-100-exclude-emotions-when-thinking\" style=\"position:relative;\">People Can’t 100% Exclude Emotions When Thinking<a href=\"#people-cant-100-exclude-emotions-when-thinking\" aria-label=\"people cant 100 exclude emotions when thinking permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>When talking about feedback, Patty McCord mainly discusses the “feedback giver’s” perspective. She says things like “don’t think your teammate will ignore or be hurt by your feedback — trust your teammate.”</p>\n<p>What disappointed me while reading this book was that it doesn’t really consider the current emotional state of the feedback receiver. Rather, Patty McCord mentions “how to converse without emotion.”</p>\n<p>Sure, trying to exclude unnecessary emotions when discussing work is a professional attitude, but is it possible for people to live completely excluding emotions?</p>\n<p>Looking at the book’s flow, the emotion Patty McCord refers to must mean negative emotion. But the book doesn’t discuss this directly, and indirectly suggests giving feedback in considerate tones through specific situation examples.</p>\n<p>Hmm, since I consider the impact of emotions on teamwork quite important, I want to discuss this more.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned once in the <a href=\"/2019/06/06/what-is-good-programmer/\">What Is a Good Developer?</a> post I wrote last June, emotions are fundamentally the result of hormones secreted after receiving brain signals. In other words, intentionally controlling emotions is never easy for people.</p>\n<p>No matter how much it’s a company and official organization, companies are ultimately communities where people gather to achieve something together. As long as people gather to communicate and do something, completely excluding emotions from that is impossible.</p>\n<p>So if I had to pick one important point in mutual communication, I’d pick the keyword “respect” first. And within this word respect lies consideration for the other person’s job and emotions.</p>\n<p>The problem is that feedback is mostly communication transmitting negative opinions.</p>\n<p>Sure, healthy feedback comes from wanting the other person to complement weaknesses and develop further, but how the feedback receiver thinks about it — nobody knows.</p>\n<p>No matter how much the hiring process proved someone doesn’t have negative views on feedback, people’s hearts aren’t always consistent. Depending on the day’s situation, they might be in a bad mood, right?</p>\n<p>For example, imagine receiving feedback from about 100 people per day while working at the company. Actually, this much feedback doesn’t bother me. Normally I’m the type who produces effects like “let’s complement this weakness” when hearing feedback.</p>\n<p>But what if my family suddenly got caught in an investment scam and the house went bankrupt overnight? Could I still accept feedback from 100 people the next day unbothered and have positive thoughts like “I should complement my weaknesses” as usual?</p>\n<p>Sure, some people might be able to, but I don’t think I could. The phrase “adding insult to injury” would float into my head, and I’d probably have negative thoughts like “things aren’t going well these days.”</p>\n<p>Like this, since people’s hearts aren’t independent of external environments, the same stimulus can produce different reactions depending on the situation. Also, unless I tell others about this situation, other people have difficulty knowing my current psychological state.</p>\n<p>Actually, the most difficult problem in communication not just at companies but all organizations is that you can’t know “the other person’s heart” at all. We’re not Protoss communicating through Khala, are we?</p>\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/169f88de0a1a76a085bc9800d4afd888/khala.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n  <br>\n  <small>Protoss share emotions and thoughts through Khala, but humans don't</small>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>Communication with others is difficult because it always proceeds in this uncertainty, and I think that person’s emotions greatly contribute to that uncertainty. For this reason, my previous workplace used a method called “check-in” every morning to express your current condition as a number between 1 and 10.</p>\n<p>A healthy feedback culture isn’t created just by the keyword honesty alone. This must be accompanied by a culture that can give feedback while “honestly” and “warmly” considering and respecting others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"just-give-feedback-in-a-soft-tone\" style=\"position:relative;\">Just Give Feedback in a Soft Tone?<a href=\"#just-give-feedback-in-a-soft-tone\" aria-label=\"just give feedback in a soft tone permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After discussing this far, many people might say “so you just need to give feedback in a soft tone?” Actually, this is also an extremely ambiguous part. The standard for “speaking softly” is also subjective per person.</p>\n<p>I received feedback about my tone exactly once at my previous workplace. At the time, I was managing a solution called JIRA that all teams used for issue management. One day I looked and noticed boards were being created indiscriminately by team or individual units, making it hard to tell at a glance which were actually used boards and which weren’t.</p>\n<p>So I asked each team whether they currently used these boards and backed up and deleted boards no longer in use. The problem occurred when I went to the CX (Customer Experience) team to ask my question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>- Knock knock -<br />\n<strong>Evan</strong>: Excuse me, does the CX team currently use the SCX board?<br />\n<strong>CX Team Member</strong>: Huh…? (surprised) No, we’re not using it right now.<br />\n<strong>Evan</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since I got confirmation, I backed up and deleted that board. But after some time passed, I received a Slack message from the CX team member asking “did we do something wrong…?”</p>\n<p>Receiving the message, I momentarily thought “why…?” But thinking about it a bit, I concluded it made sense. From the CX team’s perspective, a developer suddenly came to their department and asked “are you using this board?” without any context and left.</p>\n<p>Plus, considering that developers usually ask other teams such questions when other teams touched something and data got messed up, asking me that question wasn’t strange. From my perspective, I had lots of other work besides that task and was busy, so I just briefly asked about business. But from the listener’s perspective, it must have been confusing. <small>(Thinking back now, my expression was probably stiff too)</small></p>\n<p>Of course, after explaining the circumstances the misunderstanding cleared up, but this incident became a catalyst making me deeply consider communication.</p>\n<p>Actually, I knew my own tone wasn’t that soft. So when talking with people who don’t know me well, I pay somewhat attention to my tone. Even when I went to the CX team and asked that question, I’d paid attention in my own way. But the CX team said my tone was too stiff and scary.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, “what I perceive” and “what the other person perceives” can differ. For smooth communication, you need to be aware of this fact. And in such cases, no matter how much I paid attention, if the other person felt the tone was stiff, it’s right for me to speak more softly or complement using non-verbal communication like expressions.</p>\n<p>“Giving feedback in a soft tone” is ultimately the same. No matter how softly I speak from my perspective, probability always exists that the other person won’t perceive it that way. For a culture of honestly giving and receiving feedback to successfully settle, members’ mature consideration and development of these issues must continuously continue.</p>\n<p>Of course, Patty McCord did briefly mention not giving feedback in a “hostile or condescending tone,” but since I personally think consideration and respect for others are equally as important as honesty, I felt disappointed that this book focused too much on just “honesty.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback-between-management-and-employees\" style=\"position:relative;\">Feedback Between Management and Employees<a href=\"#feedback-between-management-and-employees\" aria-label=\"feedback between management and employees permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Patty McCord says feedback should be given and received regardless of rank, and this feedback mechanism should spread top-down from above. Hmm, but isn’t this realistically the most difficult part?</p>\n<p>No matter how much decision-making is delegated to individual practitioners and horizontal communication is pursued, management positions lead the entire company, so they carry greater responsibility and authority than ordinary employees. Plus, for us who’ve lived over 20 years experiencing all kinds of vertical structures — school, part-time jobs, military — the very fact of “horizontal relationships with the CEO” still feels awkward. <small>(This isn’t specifically Korean — it’s universal)</small></p>\n<p>For that reason, from an employee’s perspective, giving feedback to management is honestly burdensome. Sure, many companies pursue horizontal culture and actually practice such culture, but treating someone with the management title comfortably like my colleague is quite difficult.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/b467e1ac8bac2c38cc6d1c7699bf5180/c84e8/friends.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35.625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"friends\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/b467e1ac8bac2c38cc6d1c7699bf5180/c08c5/friends.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/b467e1ac8bac2c38cc6d1c7699bf5180/0913d/friends.jpg 160w,\n/static/b467e1ac8bac2c38cc6d1c7699bf5180/cb69c/friends.jpg 320w,\n/static/b467e1ac8bac2c38cc6d1c7699bf5180/c08c5/friends.jpg 640w,\n/static/b467e1ac8bac2c38cc6d1c7699bf5180/c84e8/friends.jpg 743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Making employees feel management are \"colleagues\" isn't as easy as you'd think</small>\n</center>\n<p>That’s why Patty McCord also said this feedback mechanism must spread top-down to settle. The top-down here doesn’t mean “orders” — it means management should approach first.</p>\n<p>Naturally, CEOs of many companies pursuing horizontal culture also know this fact, so they consistently make gestures saying “please treat me comfortably.” But strangely, employees’ hearts often don’t open that easily. What’s the reason?</p>\n<p>This is kind of like romance. If you say you love someone with words but only show indifferent behavior to them, can they really believe you love them? Rather, even without saying you love them, if you constantly show warm and considerate behavior, they’d probably believe you more. <small>(Actually, this kind of tsundere might be more attractive)</small></p>\n<p>Likewise, if management really wants horizontal communication and feedback, rather than saying “treat me comfortably,” I think management should approach employees comfortably first, talk about how we have horizontal relationships through periodic education, and practice behaviors like showing positive reactions when actually receiving feedback, steadily building trust with employees.</p>\n<p>That trust is: trust that giving feedback to this person won’t disadvantage me, trust that my feedback can be accepted by this person, trust that this feedback can help our entire organization develop.</p>\n<p>So looking at companies with cultures of freely giving and receiving feedback regardless of rank, you can see them continuously making efforts — periodically holding town hall meetings to publicly receive employee feedback, CEOs asking about feedback first, conducting feedback education, etc.</p>\n<p>In other words, a culture of transparently giving and receiving feedback between employees and management requires not just “honesty” but also the process of building trust with employees by showing management directly making efforts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Patty McCord’s Powerful is a book that entertainingly explains the overall content of “Freedom and Responsibility,” Netflix’s core corporate culture.

Our team composition at the time was roughly like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Skill Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Frontend (me)</td>\n<td>All I knew was C and Java from school. Last time I touched JavaScript was in 4th grade.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend</td>\n<td>Had a web design certification. The only one with any web experience on this team. Took the backend role but had never touched a server.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend 2</td>\n<td>Electrical engineering major. Also had zero knowledge of databases or web. Too busy to show up often.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UI/UX Designer</td>\n<td>In the military. Hadn’t even been discharged yet. Would work occasionally while on leave.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Planner</td>\n<td>Korean-Canadian. Music major. Zero IT experience.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Just looking at the team composition, it’s obvious we were a ragtag bunch. Writing this out again, I realize we really were out of our minds. Where did we get that confidence from?</p>\n<p>None of us had ever done web development. Ignorance breeds courage, as they say, and here’s the thing — what this group of people was trying to build was a 3D model editor that runs on the web. And that was just part of the plan; there was even more chaos to come after that. <small>(This project taught me the importance of MVPs during my college years.)</small></p>\n<p>Since I was in charge of frontend, I just dove in headfirst and somehow cobbled things together with JavaScript and jQuery. It was my first time doing anything with graphics, and my first time using <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Three.js</a>, so I struggled quite a bit with the 3D work. But thanks to that, I studied math intensively, and after about three months, I had built a prototype with basic features — loading obj files on the web, changing textures and materials, placing lights to change the atmosphere of the space, and so on.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/6a068/3deditor.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.62500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"3deditor\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/c08c5/3deditor.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/0913d/3deditor.jpg 160w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/cb69c/3deditor.jpg 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/c08c5/3deditor.jpg 640w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/6a068/3deditor.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The nostalgic café next to Hakrim Hall at Dongguk University</small>\n</center>\n<p>At one point, I saw this bald guy more often than my own mother.

This was when I first properly collaborated with people from other roles — not just developers.</p>\n<p>When bugs occurred in programs I built, customers would contact the CS team, and the CS team would report bugs to the dev team. Or I’d share ideas with designers and planners while building products. In college, it was all just side projects with friends, so I only had simple concerns like “how do I build this?” But at a company, it was completely different. Here, I had to think about additional things:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>What risks or benefits might arise from deploying this feature?</li>\n<li>Should we use an external solution to save development time, or build it ourselves with a long-term view?</li>\n<li>If feature A takes about a month to develop, but we could build two other features in that time, what choice should we make?</li>\n<li>We’ve received a lot of VoC (Voice of Customer) related to this feature — how should we solve it to satisfy users?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>At the time, designers, developers, and planners freely exchanged opinions on these issues. That’s when I realized that ultimately, the most important things for a company are <strong>customers</strong> and <strong>money</strong>.</p>\n<p>This might sound obvious. But arriving at this thought has had a huge influence on my values as a developer. Sure, there are many other important things at a company — employee satisfaction, culture, and so on — but customers and money are the fundamentals. No matter how well I build a program, it’s meaningless if no one uses it. And no matter how great a company’s culture and benefits are, if there’s no money, the company will eventually fail. So this was the first time I thought:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even as a developer, only thinking about technical things might be a narrow perspective.\nUltimately, what I’m building is a product that people use, and I should build it for people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From then on, I thought a lot about how becoming a good developer means thinking deeply about business and users too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"are-emotions-unnecessary-in-professional-work\" style=\"position:relative;\">Are Emotions Unnecessary in Professional Work?<a href=\"#are-emotions-unnecessary-in-professional-work\" aria-label=\"are emotions unnecessary in professional work permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I still continue to work at startups. The reason is that I can take on diverse work that wouldn’t be possible at larger companies, and I enjoy freely sharing opinions and deriving rational conclusions through healthy debate.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all good. Since people gather together, there are various events — feelings get hurt between colleagues, conflicts arise between team members and the company. Especially since the atmosphere is so free, we treat each other almost like friends, and occasionally, <strong>mistakes</strong> happen. <small>(Of course, no matter how flat or free the organization is, everyone maintains basic courtesy.)</small></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 540px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 140%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAcABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBAgQF/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHk0bCLAG6MWiaSQV//xAAcEAACAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADEBITMiH/2gAIAQEAAQUCJv4YVItT7rczMrNjBNhaf//EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBH/2gAIAQMBAT8BiZp//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBH/2gAIAQIBAT8BIf/EABkQAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAQIhEf/aAAgBAQAGPwJ5DgqsOr//xAAdEAEBAAMAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMRBRcYGx/9oACAEBAAE/IbhPzztCLztx2Ii734cZs5myRo5H1nPxiAJfjHaZ9Gf/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEM//AMD/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQ/9oACAEDAQE/EMgh0z//xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARARIf/aAAgBAgEBPxCHpFH/xAAfEAEBAAIBBAMAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMRBBUYFxobH/2gAIAQEAAT8QAAOAdA/OvKMAAkobTAA8gEp5z2PvNFG1B3cTvQ7fE394pEaPDMiuVuJ3xSgC8N2XHiOECAHxn//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"everyone\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/0913d/everyone.jpg 160w,\n/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/cb69c/everyone.jpg 320w,\n/static/e2140f5e349ad0ef493dfc5c2f58068c/09d21/everyone.jpg 540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Some mystery meme someone registered.

It’s more like “somewhere between coworkers and friends.” It might sound like splitting hairs, but anyway, I don’t think of them as purely professional relationships.

Even freelancers must communicate with clients.

Of course, I’m shy by nature, so I’m not exactly a warm person. <small>(I’ve been told since childhood that I give bad first impressions.)</small> But regardless of individual personality, I believe we should at least have respect and consideration for the people we collaborate with. Personally, I think anyone can improve their technical hard skills if they work hard — the speed might differ, but everyone improves. And I believe developers are already putting effort into their technical specs without anyone having to tell them.</p>\n<p>But soft skills like communication and consideration for others are easy to neglect unconsciously unless you pay attention regularly, so I think it’s important to keep reflecting, stay mindful, and maintain an attitude of seeking continuous feedback. Recently, I received feedback from someone on another team that my tone is too stiff and intimidating, which was a bit discouraging. But since then, I’ve been trying to be more mindful of how I speak. I’m not sure if it’s working though… haha</p>\n<p>So these are my thoughts and conclusions so far, after four years of working as a developer and pondering <strong>what makes a good developer</strong>. I still have many more years of work and life ahead, so my current conclusions might change again. But I think “an attitude of consideration for others” remains important whether I’m a developer or doing something else entirely.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190606-what-is-good-programmer-en","path":"/2019/06/06/what-is-good-programmer/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Makes a Good Developer?","subTitle":"Beyond coding skills — reflections on becoming someone others want to work with","date":"Jun 06, 2019","categories":["Essay","Soft Skills"],"tags":["Good Programmer","Developer","Programmer","Soft Skills"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/3a812/3deditor.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/3a812/3deditor.jpg 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/4b287/3deditor.jpg 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/fc5c5/3deditor.webp 320w,\n/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/e9225/3deditor.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/2d839/3deditor.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/2d839/3deditor.jpg 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8e3799a686b0ec2f2f6b8877b80bea42/b384d/3deditor.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Soft Skills","lang":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3523904809","650499039"],"slicesMap":{}}
