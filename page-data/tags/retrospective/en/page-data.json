At the time, the frontend position in the Insurtech silo was vacant, so when work requiring frontend came up, either the product designer did markup directly or we got support from frontend developers in other silos.</p>\n<p>Those expectations felt a bit burdensome, but everyone helped me adapt well and made me comfortable, so I could quickly follow up on past history and get involved in the Insurtech silo’s goals.</p>\n<p>Also, the Toss team is quite lenient about failure compared to other organizations, and the speed of learning from these failures and applying them to the next challenge is very fast. For this reason, working here means the ideation, decision-making, development, deployment, and result analysis iterations repeat endlessly, making it fun but quite hectic.</p>\n<p>That might be why this year flew by faster than usual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleaning-up-legacy-code\" style=\"position:relative;\">Cleaning Up Legacy Code<a href=\"#cleaning-up-legacy-code\" aria-label=\"cleaning up legacy code permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>My first product when I joined was an insurance-related internal product. At the time, this product didn’t even have TDS (Toss Design System) attached, was developed so urgently that the internal design wasn’t solid, and had development environment differences from other Toss products — there was a lot to improve.</p>\n<p>When I first take on a product, I look through its commit history. Looking at commit history tells you how the product was developed following business context, and roughly what design direction the developer before me was trying to take.</p>\n<p>After looking at this product’s commit history, my first thought was “the schedule was f***ing tight…” Usually with commits you can group them by feature — commits for feature A, commits for feature B — but this product had very short gaps between developing one feature and the next, and sometimes multiple features were developed in a single day.</p>\n<p>But as always, you can’t carve out time for refactoring when you’re busy developing features to keep up with rapidly changing business context, so I had no choice but to refactor bit by bit following the <a href=\"https://johngrib.github.io/wiki/Boy-Scout-Rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boy Scout Rule</a>.</p>\n<p>My refactoring goal at the time was simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make it so any frontend developer at Toss could take over this product without feeling out of place!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I handled this product from December last year to August this year — roughly 9 months. The seemingly endless refactoring showed some results just by doing it steadily.</p>\n<p>When I first arrived, deployment was done by manually running scripts, but now the process of developing features, raising PRs, and running CI/CD matches other Toss products, so other frontend developers can develop features and deploy in the same development environment.</p>\n<p>Also, this product’s domain characteristic was complex models, naturally making client state very complex too. At the time, all this complex state was managed with context, so context was a messy mix of state-holding objects, <code class=\"language-text\">dispatch</code> functions for state changes, functions for async processing, reducers, etc.</p>\n<p>So I introduced Redux, which Toss uses a lot, separated async processing functions into middleware, and split stores by data domain to make them somewhat easier to understand. The Redux introduction itself wasn’t high difficulty, and even with Redux the state complexity is still high, but I think matching the development environment with other Toss products has more significance.</p>\n<p>There was also a problem synchronizing server state and client state. When initially developing this product, there wasn’t much time, so it was developed using a Poll method that called the API once per second. So state changes happened once per second, and worse, many components shared this state through Prop drilling based on Context, causing unnecessary rendering once per second too.</p>\n<p>So I tried to improve rendering performance using Redux and react-redux hooks and change the API Poll to a Push method. But ultimately I only finished the Redux introduction and rendering optimization before this product left my hands.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, when I mentioned this to the FE developer who took over this product, they empathized with the direction I was trying to take, and recently finished the refactoring by removing the Poll method and changing to Push. <small>(Thanks to them, I took one burden off my mind)</small></p>\n<p>Of course there are still many disappointing parts, but it feels good that it improved a lot compared to the beginning. I left at dawn several times because of this product and struggled whenever developing features, but I worked on it with affection for 9 months, so it became… a kind of love-hate relationship.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sig-weekend-work-channel\" style=\"position:relative;\">#sig-weekend-work Channel<a href=\"#sig-weekend-work-channel\" aria-label=\"sig weekend work channel permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Besides work, I also do toy projects and write blog posts, so on weekends I often gather with friends at nice cafes to eat delicious food and work together.

After about an hour of heated discussion, we aligned our directions and defined the channel interface — quite a fun memory.</p>\n<p>Also, going to a Turkish restaurant in Songdo with weekend work members where we were the only Koreans felt like we were abroad, and playing billiards betting at the billiards hall behind the office after work was fun too.</p>\n<p>Recently as COVID got serious, we stopped meeting on weekends like before, but when COVID recedes, I think this channel will reactivate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"one-direction-various-methods\" style=\"position:relative;\">One Direction, Various Methods<a href=\"#one-direction-various-methods\" aria-label=\"one direction various methods permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Working at any company, you face moments requiring decisions.

So I live whipping myself daily saying “still not enough.” This is less about my passion being great and more about fearing that the moment I think “I did well enough,” I’ll stop making efforts to grow. <small>(Eventually this led to burnout, but habits don’t change easily…)</small></p>\n<p>One thing I felt during this mentoring: I apply this standard not just to myself but to others too.</p>\n<p>Regardless of skill level, I think we must constantly strive for growth. And to make such consistent effort, goal-setting and motivation must be clear.</p>\n<p>So before becoming a developer, I tried experiencing various things — b-boying, composing, sound engineering, programming — to find “something I can do reasonably well while enjoying.”</p>\n<p>This was how I grew, so naturally I thought this was the right method. Rather than just thinking with your head, move your body to try as many challenges as possible, see results, judge, then continue the next challenge. So when mentoring, I often told mentees these things.</p>\n<p>When mentees said they struggled with the project because of work, or felt frustrated that skills weren’t improving, I didn’t really understand. Honestly, I thought it was just lack of passion and motivation. So I always told mentees things like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hey, I did it, so there’s absolutely no reason you can’t. Try challenging it, and if it really doesn’t work, let’s talk again then!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Of course you lack time for toy projects while working. You need to create time yourself, even by reducing sleep.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Skills absolutely can’t improve quickly in the short term, so don’t be anxious. Just keep at it consistently and you’ll grow at some point. So you should cultivate the habit of coding even a little each day. Endure even if it’s hard.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 512px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/36dd4/whipper.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"whipper\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/36dd4/whipper.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/0913d/whipper.jpg 160w,\n/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/cb69c/whipper.jpg 320w,\n/static/1814c31fd325ae8f46c8a26324434305/36dd4/whipper.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This wasn't mentoring, it was professional whipping</small>\n</center>\n<p>I don’t think what I said then was wrong. You can’t reduce work hours just because you lack physical time to invest in personal growth due to work, so reducing sleep is a reasonable method. And the easiest way to improve skills is consistently training even a little daily, overcoming the feeling of difficulty and reluctance.</p>\n<p>After 3 months of mentoring, we had a final retrospective, and the frontend developer from the team I mentored said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I reduced sleep to do the toy project as you suggested, but lack of sleep kept making me lose focus and my physical condition worsened 😢</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t show it, but hearing this felt like getting hit in the head with a hammer. That’s when I thought “Ah, I just had better stamina than them to handle that crazy schedule.”</p>\n<p>Learning methods that work efficiently differ per person, but I just pushed what I’d done for the past 6 years thinking it was right. Of course, growth methods similar to mine work well for some people, but at least those I mentored weren’t people for whom this method worked well.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, what I missed as a mentor was empathy and difference. When mentees said they were struggling, I didn’t empathize with the problem and try to solve it together. I just dismissed those as whining or amateurism, emphasizing only properly finishing the project even if pushing themselves to the extreme. <small>(And I felt like an old fogy realizing this, so I was depressed for a while)</small></p>\n<p>If you repeatedly don’t work because it’s hard, teammates’ trust will gradually disappear. This team has only one frontend, backend, and designer each, so if even one person doesn’t work, the project drops. Have responsibility. Give trust to colleagues. Along with these words.</p>\n<p>These words are hard to call wrong, but a mentor who only pushes this way isn’t a good mentor — just a scolding teacher. A mentor should be able to maintain mentees’ morale and motivation to some degree, but I focused too much on launching the project itself.</p>\n<p>So until last month I kept pondering answers to this problem. At the company I also received feedback to “become someone who thinks about not just individual growth but team growth,” making me want to find answers even more.</p>\n<p>But I still don’t really know. Just empathizing unconditionally won’t help mentees grow, and just whipping doesn’t help either.</p>\n<p>Ultimately you need to understand what growth methods work for the person, give appropriate motivation and advice, and bring out their potential. But analyzing people, not computers, is still too difficult for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"everyones-rolled-a-lot\" style=\"position:relative;\">Everyone’s Rolled A Lot…<a href=\"#everyones-rolled-a-lot\" aria-label=\"everyones rolled a lot permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I’d done retrospectives on things the Lubycon team did before, but never really thought about retrospecting the team itself. Recently as things to do together with these friends increased, some new thoughts started emerging.</p>\n<p>While running the mentoring project mentioned earlier, I properly took on work with friends for the first time in a while. Working with friends like this, the feeling I recently felt was “Everyone’s really rolled a lot…” <small>(Belatedly realizing this)</small></p>\n<p>Now most have 5-6 years of experience as working professionals, but thinking back to university days, this team was just a total rookie gathering. More like a friend group than a toy project team. We didn’t know how to collaborate properly and fought all the time.</p>\n<p>Of course, during semester or vacation we gathered daily in Dongguk University Panya Hall basement to ideate, develop, and design together, but back then it was more fun just hanging out with them than developing. Going to PC rooms to crush some games, drinking, billiards, karaoke, sometimes cursing each other out.</p>\n<p>Then this year suddenly the team got busy with lots of work and collaboration increased dramatically. Watching everyone smoothly solve problems popping up everywhere felt a bit strange. In my memory, Lubycon was a team that did lots of fumbling and spent all day googling because we didn’t know methods, but at some point working in this team started feeling similar to working at the office with such smooth progress.</p>\n<p>Recently there was a major accident where the DB table containing mentoring project applicant data got deleted while deploying a serverless framework application, but later we found out the friend in the DevOps role had been continuously backing up, so it passed without incident. When friction arose from project direction or Lubycon team agenda — macroscopic values — not syncing, I remember we also coordinated opinions well and solved it.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/e996b/lubycon3.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"lubycon3\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/6af66/lubycon3.png\" srcset=\"/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/69538/lubycon3.png 160w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/72799/lubycon3.png 320w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/6af66/lubycon3.png 640w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/d9199/lubycon3.png 960w,\n/static/51285d2856115eebe4ea358e70ca1ee4/e996b/lubycon3.png 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Let's make backups a lifestyle... that terrifying day's memory</small>\n</center>\n<p>Though each walked slightly different paths, rolling in the field for 6 years makes now being more grown than university days natural.

Since this was my first time mentoring, I didn’t know giving someone attention and leading them required so many resources.</p>\n<p>Until now I was a developer who only took care of my own growth. I thought each person’s growth, whether soft skills or hard skills, was something each person had to manage. Then individual growth would lead to team growth. If a teammate didn’t grow as much as others, of course you should help your best, but if they still can’t keep up even with help, ultimately cutting them off was right.</p>\n<p>But during this mentoring, doubts started sprouting that this thinking might be wrong. Just vaguely helping isn’t the answer. Depending on who leads and mentors how, this person’s potential could burst out or die right there.</p>\n<p>As I gradually build my career, I could become someone’s mentor, someone’s role model, or a leader of some team. I think it’s time for deep contemplation on whether I can properly perform that role when the situation comes.</p>\n<p>I can’t be a developer who only looks after my own growth forever. Now I need to look after not just myself but organizational growth too.</p>\n<p>So recently I’ve been talking with fellow developers about topics like “What is a senior developer?”, got recommended and am reading the book <a href=\"http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/67350256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Growing Together</a>, but haven’t found answers on what methods are right yet.</p>\n<p>In 2020 I end this retrospective with questions I couldn’t answer. But for my 2021 retrospective next year, I’ll set a goal to find answers to these questions and concerns and write them in the retrospective.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20201229-2020-retrospective-en","path":"/2020/12/29/2020-retrospective/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2020, How Did I Grow?

The first month or two was spent planning the book’s content and aligning with my co-author friend, so about 10 months of actual writing.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I started thinking it’d be like a long blog post, but there were way more differences from blogging than I expected. Blog posts contain at most 200-300 lines of short content, but writing 400 pages worth of content that flows in a single breath was an extremely unfamiliar experience.</p>\n<p>Plus, unlike blog posts, this was a project with a clear deadline. No matter how tired I was after work on weekdays, I had to write the book, making it quite hard to maintain focus.</p>\n<p>Beyond the book’s content, I also had to write and test 2 SPA applications and an API server application as examples for the book. Even with two people working together, it was tough.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/a0d7a940a1ee51e88375162b33c9aef5/715a3/postman.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 108.74999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"postman\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/a0d7a940a1ee51e88375162b33c9aef5/6af66/postman.png\" srcset=\"/static/a0d7a940a1ee51e88375162b33c9aef5/69538/postman.png 160w,\n/static/a0d7a940a1ee51e88375162b33c9aef5/72799/postman.png 320w,\n/static/a0d7a940a1ee51e88375162b33c9aef5/6af66/postman.png 640w,\n/static/a0d7a940a1ee51e88375162b33c9aef5/715a3/postman.png 830w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>We shared the APIs we wrote through Postman</small>\n</center>\n<p>That’s why my friend and I explored various methods to maximize efficiency, one of which was the idea of writing the book using Git and Markdown.</p>\n<p>The publisher originally asked us to write in MS Word, but Word has the problem of requiring manual mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts to apply style formats like headings and footnotes. Markdown, however, lets you batch-apply unified styles using CSS later, making it far more efficient.</p>\n<p>After finishing the final draft, we used a library called <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pandoc</a> to convert <code class=\"language-text\">*.md</code> files to <code class=\"language-text\">*.docx</code> files and sent them to the publisher.</p>\n<p>Also, since we both constantly use Git for work and side projects, we were comfortable with it. We could version control both the example applications and book writing using Git, which let us shorten work time significantly and catch bugs or missed parts.</p>\n<p>Plus, since all the book’s content was written in Markdown and could only merge to the master branch after passing code review, the process was great for aligning on parts where our opinions differed.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/2a0f8bcc5978fcc9bd4e5ddb70c04886/7a4b2/code-review.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 113.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"code review\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/2a0f8bcc5978fcc9bd4e5ddb70c04886/6af66/code-review.png\" srcset=\"/static/2a0f8bcc5978fcc9bd4e5ddb70c04886/69538/code-review.png 160w,\n/static/2a0f8bcc5978fcc9bd4e5ddb70c04886/72799/code-review.png 320w,\n/static/2a0f8bcc5978fcc9bd4e5ddb70c04886/6af66/code-review.png 640w,\n/static/2a0f8bcc5978fcc9bd4e5ddb70c04886/d9199/code-review.png 960w,\n/static/2a0f8bcc5978fcc9bd4e5ddb70c04886/7a4b2/code-review.png 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Fiercely debating whether SSR servers are frontend territory or not</small>\n</center>\n<p>My co-author is a very close friend, but this was the first time we worked together on something this official beyond side projects.

If you look at my archive, you can see posting volume suddenly increased sharply starting in June 2019 — right when book writing was wrapping up and I was receiving reviews from reviewers.</p>\n<p>Also, posts before June 2019 — like calculating planetary orbits or building simple neural networks — felt more like an archive for content I’d studied. But posts written after June 2019 started covering more general topics like JavaScript and Git.</p>\n<p>The reason posting volume increased and topics changed at this point wasn’t just that my writing skills grew through book writing — the bigger reason was a slight shift in my mindset about blog posting after this point.</p>\n<p>I’m fundamentally not someone with a lot of confidence in my skills. So I thought “whatever I know, everyone else probably knows too.” But book writing changed my thinking through the study sessions we held.</p>\n<p>My friend and I held study sessions doubling as book reviews with others using content we’d written during the writing process.

I learned a lot experiencing the company grow from just about 10 employees to raising Series A and B funding, and met great colleagues.</p>\n<p>Looking back, before joining this company I was a greenhorn developer with less than a year of startup experience and one entrepreneurship attempt. I’d built many unusual things as side projects, but I wasn’t necessarily better at coding than others. I guess you could say it was a time when I found the act of making things more interesting than making things well.</p>\n<p>But all the work environments I experienced after graduating college were continuous processes of finding and solving problems myself rather than doing what someone told me to do. So naturally I became comfortable making decisions about problems, and also wasn’t afraid to take responsibility for those decisions.</p>\n<p>Early-stage startups always lack human resources and don’t have systems where someone makes every decision for you, so individuals often need to become leaders within their responsibility scope. My experiences fit well with Brave Mobile, which was a small-scale startup at the time, letting me work more enjoyably.</p>\n<p>So from early after joining, I made countless decisions holding overall decision-making authority over frontend applications. Some of those were good choices, some weren’t — but either way, these experiences were great nutrients for growth for a greenhorn developer like me.</p>\n<p>When I first joined in 2017, the service called Soomgo was a traditional MPA application without even a frontend framework attached. I remember opening the source code for the first time and finding traces of a failed React integration attempt and Vue with just basic scaffolding as boilerplate sitting there.</p>\n<p>In other words, my first mission after joining was somehow applying Vue to a Django-written MPA application. At the time, there weren’t many references for using Vue this way, so I remember struggling. <small>(Unfairly, now Googling turns up quite a few references)</small></p>\n<p>As time passed and things got a bit easier, I gradually made the application more solid — building my own SSR server using Express and introducing TypeScript. This process is also one of the quite valuable experiences you can have at an early-stage startup where nothing’s built yet.</p>\n<p>Also, since I held decision-making authority over frontend applications, frequent communication with various roles — not just backend developers but designers, POs, marketers — necessarily occurred, and these experiences were also quite fun. Thanks to that, I could learn about what other roles do besides development, and it was an opportunity to think a lot about teamwork.</p>\n<p>And since Brave Mobile was an organization that deeply considered efficient agile processes, I got to enjoy the luxury of receiving coaching from a famous agile coach with expensive fees. I summarized what I learned from agile coaching in a post called <a href=\"/2019/07/02/what-is-agile/\">What Exactly Is This Agile Thing?</a>.</p>\n<p>But as time passed, daily work of handling repeated tasks with familiar people continued, and opportunities for new experiences gradually decreased while thirst for growth grew. Also, since the deadline for satisfying the condition “travel abroad alone before my twenties end” on my wish list was exactly this year, I decided to resign after long consideration.</p>\n<p>The post I wrote when leaving, <a href=\"/2019/08/17/leave-the-company/\">Leaving the Company I Worked at for 2 Years</a>, has more details, so check that out if you’re curious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"living-in-prague-for-a-month\" style=\"position:relative;\">Living in Prague for a Month<a href=\"#living-in-prague-for-a-month\" aria-label=\"living in prague for a month permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After leaving Brave Mobile, I put into action the dream I’d had since age 20: “traveling abroad alone.” Actually, I haven’t traveled abroad that much, and when I did travel abroad it was always with friends or family. So thinking about leaving Korea alone was a bit scary, but once I booked the plane ticket my resolve suddenly hardened and I completed all reservations in a single day.</p>\n<p>And since this wasn’t taking vacation but leaving after quitting my job to travel freely, I didn’t need to set a tight schedule like 4 nights 5 days. I personally don’t prefer travel styles of rushing through tourist spots on tight schedules, so I set this trip’s concept as “living for a month.”</p>\n<p>I’d barely been anywhere in Europe except Moscow in my life, so this time I wanted to smell more European air. Since I’d signed a 2-month freelance contract with Brave Mobile after quitting, I searched for destinations based on the condition “Europe but with fast internet.”</p>\n<p>While researching, I obtained information that Prague and Budapest had beautiful cities and fast internet for Europe, and ultimately concluded I’d spend a month living in Prague.</p>\n<p>The problem was that the only information I knew about Prague was Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and Prague Lovers. My thinking at the time was this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m living there for a month anyway, so I’ll figure it out when I get there haha (happy circuit activated)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/fea1a611a5d34689a7e5cca06a8a8fca/15ec7/real.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 68.12499999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"real\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/fea1a611a5d34689a7e5cca06a8a8fca/c08c5/real.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/fea1a611a5d34689a7e5cca06a8a8fca/0913d/real.jpg 160w,\n/static/fea1a611a5d34689a7e5cca06a8a8fca/cb69c/real.jpg 320w,\n/static/fea1a611a5d34689a7e5cca06a8a8fca/c08c5/real.jpg 640w,\n/static/fea1a611a5d34689a7e5cca06a8a8fca/15ec7/real.jpg 690w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Don't activate happy circuits, properly research before going</small>\n</center>\n<p>One thing I seriously missed was the carry-on ban for 2015 15-inch MacBook Pros. At the time there was an issue where you couldn’t bring MacBook Pros on planes depending on each country’s government guidelines or airline safety regulations, following a battery explosion accident in the US. And I missed this.</p>\n<p>I accidentally learned about this fact the evening before departure and emailed Czech Airlines to inquire, but since it was the weekend, naturally I received no response by flight time.</p>\n<p>Checking the European Aviation Safety Agency homepage showed that the EU’s position was you can carry it on if you just turn off the power during flight, but airline safety regulations differ by airline. Plus I thought if guidelines strengthened more when returning to Korea, I might have to leave the MacBook Pro in Czech Republic. So ultimately I brought my 2009 antique MacBook Pro. <small>(Thanks to which the mac died in Prague and I got it repaired)</small></p>\n<p>Another thing was English didn’t work as well as expected. Czech uses Czech, which feels similar to Russian, but I was careless thinking everyone in Prague would speak English well since it’s so famous as a tourist destination.</p>\n<p>But my accommodation wasn’t near tourist areas, so there weren’t as many people who spoke English well as I thought, and I struggled quite a bit communicating. So from now on, when traveling to non-English-speaking countries, I plan to study enough to speak at least basic words and grammar in that country’s language before going.</p>\n<p>The information I struggled to obtain in Prague is organized in the post <a href=\"/2019/09/06/life-in-prague-tip/\">Surviving as a Digital Nomad in Prague</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meaningful-small-talk-gatherings-with-developers\" style=\"position:relative;\">Meaningful Small Talk Gatherings with Developers<a href=\"#meaningful-small-talk-gatherings-with-developers\" aria-label=\"meaningful small talk gatherings with developers permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/6618edead71bb0185b3568ceecc6cb4e/e5166/chit-chat.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 73.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"chit chat\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/6618edead71bb0185b3568ceecc6cb4e/c08c5/chit-chat.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/6618edead71bb0185b3568ceecc6cb4e/0913d/chit-chat.jpg 160w,\n/static/6618edead71bb0185b3568ceecc6cb4e/cb69c/chit-chat.jpg 320w,\n/static/6618edead71bb0185b3568ceecc6cb4e/c08c5/chit-chat.jpg 640w,\n/static/6618edead71bb0185b3568ceecc6cb4e/6a068/chit-chat.jpg 960w,\n/static/6618edead71bb0185b3568ceecc6cb4e/e5166/chit-chat.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>In November 2019, Lubycon — the toy project team I’ve been running with friends since college — held a small talk gathering called Chit Chat.</p>\n<p>While developers have more gatherings like conferences and networking compared to other roles, most of these gatherings’ topics focus on technology itself. Since there aren’t many opportunities to officially share individual thoughts or values, I thought it would be nice to have a space for discussing topics outside technology.</p>\n<p>That’s why we planned a small talk gathering for sharing stories about soft skills. Various developers of different career levels and different roles gathered and had a great experience sharing individual thoughts about soft skills for two hours.</p>\n<p>But since this was the first event I’d ever organized, there were worrying parts. Actually, I’m a bit shy, so I don’t usually participate in networking or conferences frequently. This time I had to take on the moderator role for discussion, which felt burdensome.</p>\n<p>But once people gathered and discussion started, everyone passionately shared their opinions, so there wasn’t actually much for me to do as moderator. I just enjoyed the discussion itself and had fun.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious what topics and stories we shared at Chit Chat, you can check out the <a href=\"https://lubycon.io/magazines/2019/11/18/1st-chit-chat-retrospective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lubycon 1st Chit Chat Retrospective</a> post on the Lubycon team blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-beginning\" style=\"position:relative;\">A New Beginning<a href=\"#a-new-beginning\" aria-label=\"a new beginning permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/360b015c1813e039e0c22a30ce973987/ad68d/toss.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 58.12500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"toss\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/360b015c1813e039e0c22a30ce973987/c08c5/toss.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/360b015c1813e039e0c22a30ce973987/0913d/toss.jpg 160w,\n/static/360b015c1813e039e0c22a30ce973987/cb69c/toss.jpg 320w,\n/static/360b015c1813e039e0c22a30ce973987/c08c5/toss.jpg 640w,\n/static/360b015c1813e039e0c22a30ce973987/6a068/toss.jpg 960w,\n/static/360b015c1813e039e0c22a30ce973987/ad68d/toss.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>Though I haven’t officially mentioned it through the blog, I joined Viva Republica, which makes the financial service Toss, starting December 9th.</p>\n<p>There are various reasons I chose this company, but the biggest reason was thinking the Toss team is “an organization that works enjoyably.”</p>\n<p>I haven’t experienced much at this company yet and am just learning things one by one, but I definitely feel the Toss team itself has energetic vibes.</p>\n<p>Plus, since there are so many people good at both work and development, I can receive stimulation, which is nice.

When I was young, the age of thirty had this “adult” image to me, but now standing right before thirty and looking at myself, I don’t really feel like I’ve become an adult. Just feels like I aged one more year.</p>\n<p>This year I made many attempts and achieved some results. I published a book, lived in Europe for a month, and changed jobs to a new workplace. What’s important is these things weren’t planned from long ago — I just did what I wanted to do at each moment.</p>\n<p>Actually, since age 17 I’ve had one principle I pledged to myself: “live doing only what I want to do.” Some people say I’m immature when I say this, and some say understanding compromise with reality is being an adult. But if that’s what being an adult means, I think it’s okay not to become one.</p>\n<p>Living doing only what you want doesn’t mean living selfishly. Everyone knows living doing only what you want in reality isn’t easy. Naturally, it requires much accompanying effort.</p>\n<p>I loved coding so much I wanted to work as a developer, so I studied hard and became a developer. I wanted to help others using the knowledge I have, so I keep steadily writing blog posts.</p>\n<p>I think these small challenges and efforts can gather to create the reality of “definitely do what I want to do.” Well, I can’t guarantee anything since I don’t know what difficult things will come next, but I’ll try to carry this value until I’m in my coffin.</p>\n<p>That’s why in 2020, I’m thinking of trying a challenge related to “presentations” or “lectures.” Watching people who present or lecture makes me think they’re amazing, but standing in front of others and saying something is a bit scary, so I’ve kept putting it off. But this year I want to gather courage.</p>\n<p>That’s all for this retrospective looking back on 2019, the last of my twenties.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20191222-2019-retrospective-en","path":"/2019/12/22/2019-retrospective/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Last of My Twenties: Looking Back on 2019","subTitle":"My 2019, as seen from the tail end of my twenties","date":"Dec 22, 2019","categories":["Essay"],"tags":["Retrospective","29 Years Old","Developer"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/d803c/thumbnail.png","srcSet":"/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/d803c/thumbnail.png 320w,\n/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/2a1fd/thumbnail.png 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/fc5c5/thumbnail.webp 320w,\n/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/e9225/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/01fb2/thumbnail.png","srcSet":"/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/01fb2/thumbnail.png 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/593710dba7706a667b4fa57cea95dadc/b384d/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"bf92d494-dc41-5f21-9f55-0fc8452e1ae0","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#the-legacy-code-i-created\">The Legacy Code I Created</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#from-tech-supremacist-to-developer-who-sees-organizations\">From Tech Supremacist to Developer Who Sees Organizations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-being-the-same-team-means\">What Being the Same Team Means</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#becoming-someone-who-helps-others\">Becoming Someone Who Helps Others</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#from-loner-to-somewhat-social\">From Loner to Somewhat Social</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#stimulation-from-capable-team-members\">Stimulation from Capable Team Members</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Today, August 16, 2019 was my last day at the company I’ve worked at for the past 2 years.

This was my first time experiencing a company grow like this, so there were fun parts, but I also felt nostalgic for when the company was smaller watching the company culture and organizational atmosphere change as the organization grew.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I’m quitting the company today for rest and recharge, so let me reflect from memories of when I joined to today, 2 years later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-legacy-code-i-created\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Legacy Code I Created<a href=\"#the-legacy-code-i-created\" aria-label=\"the legacy code i created permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Before joining this company, I was an idle developer who spectacularly failed a startup with someone I knew and was playing around making various toy projects alone for about 2 months. One day, while coding alone at my regular cafe in Hongdae, some strange foreign guy sent me an interview offer message on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>After exchanging a few words, the service he was making seemed interesting, and the company’s atmosphere and vision seemed to match me well, so I interviewed the next week and got hired on the spot right after the interview ended. The only Q&#x26;A from that time I still remember is this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>CTO</strong>: Can you do VueJS by any chance? We’re trying to make something like this… <small>(showing components from another service)</small></p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: I’ve barely used Vue… but I think I can make it if I study personally while working.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thinking back after the interview, I thought “what did these people even see in me to hire me…?” - but I could understand the current situation on my first day. First, I was this company’s first frontend developer. The CTO had been operating an existing Django-only project and felt the need for a frontend framework, tried introducing React once but failed, and as a fallback somehow got Vue barely working.</p>\n<p>But since the CTO was a backend developer at the time, they wanted someone with frontend expertise to break through this situation, so I was chosen. So the first work I did after joining was using <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gulp</a> and <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webpack</a> to create the frontend build process and integrate the bundled files with Django.</p>\n<p>But due to the business situation at the time, we couldn’t completely separate the frontend application from Django, so we had no choice but to apply a method where Django renders HTML once using its own template engine on the server, then Vue performs secondary rendering on the client.</p>\n<p>And searching “Django Vue” on Google in 2019 now shows several posts explaining how to use Django templates and Vue simultaneously, but when I was doing this work in May 2017, not a single such reference existed, so I had to design everything myself and come up with ideas to integrate them.</p>\n<p>I should have written a post about this work back then, but I’d just joined so I was too busy just understanding the entire codebase to think about posting.</p>\n<p>Ultimately this application is now called legacy by the current frontend chapter and became an application that nobody including me wants to touch - but honestly it was the best choice at that time so I don’t regret that decision. However, it was my first experience having code I wrote get called legacy by other developers over time, which was kind of interesting.</p>\n<p>This code had such a deformed structure difficult for typical frontend developers to understand that even while making it I thought “this will definitely be a problem later…?”</p>\n<p>Listing all the problems is hard, but representative issues were: multiple Vue instances existing, parts requiring Django knowledge to modify, and impossible complete migration from bower to npm since the existing code used bower packages. Of course, these issues are ongoing.</p>\n<p>These things pile up one by one to accumulate technical debt, so it had to be paid off someday. So I signed a 2-month freelance contract with my current company after resignation to migrate all frontend applications attached to this legacy application to a newly made frontend application project. <small>(Like cleaning up my own mess)</small></p>\n<h2 id=\"from-tech-supremacist-to-developer-who-sees-organizations\" style=\"position:relative;\">From Tech Supremacist to Developer Who Sees Organizations<a href=\"#from-tech-supremacist-to-developer-who-sees-organizations\" aria-label=\"from tech supremacist to developer who sees organizations permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I mentioned this once in a post called <a href=\"/2019/06/06/what-is-good-programmer/\">What Is a Good Developer?</a>, but when I first joined this company, my standard for a good developer was “a developer who develops requirements quickly and perfectly” and my development style was “makes things fast but has many small bugs.”</p>\n<p>So I tried to defend against my unreliable code through unit tests or design patterns that can reduce mistakes to supplement this weakness.</p>\n<p>But unlike my first job, here the CTO didn’t make all decisions - frontend developers made decisions about frontend applications. I had to do not just supplementing my weaknesses but also design and infrastructure that can flexibly respond to business, analyzing current application problems, and much more. Also, communicating outside the team was something I as a frontend developer had to do directly. <small>(Especially communicated a lot with the marketing team about SEO, user behavior data collection, etc.)</small></p>\n<p>Through this process, my conception of development expanded greatly - whereas before I mainly pondered “how can I develop better?”, after going through this process I pondered more “how can this application improve?” Going further, now I’m pondering not just applications but “how can this team work more efficiently?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-being-the-same-team-means\" style=\"position:relative;\">What Being the Same Team Means<a href=\"#what-being-the-same-team-means\" aria-label=\"what being the same team means permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Not long after I joined, the company received Series A investment, and the CEO’s promise then was “let’s go on a workshop abroad when we get investment!” So barely a month after joining I went on a workshop to Danang, Vietnam. <small>(Jackpot)</small></p>\n<p>It was about 3 nights 4 days I think, but the problem exploded the night before returning to Korea. A feature I’d developed before coming on the workshop wasn’t working at all in Internet Explorer. That feature had been deployed for about 3 weeks, and as users couldn’t use that feature in IE, the data flow chart started drawing strangely.</p>\n<p>Since not a single person in the company used IE at the time, we didn’t discover this problem early. But the biggest responsibility lay with me who developed that feature and didn’t properly test cross-browsing. So I immediately opened my MacBook and started hotfixing when I heard about it, but the time was already past midnight.</p>\n<p>The emotions I felt then were, um, self-blame for not testing properly and guilt for causing damage to the company through my carelessness. Anyway, I had to fix this quickly so I frantically analyzed and found the cause - the biggest problem was <code class=\"language-text\">Array.prototype.findIndex</code> method wasn’t properly transpiled by babel, plus several other minor issues. <small>(I haven’t trusted babel since)</small></p>\n<p>Fortunately I quickly found the bug cause, but the real problem was Vietnam’s internet was too slow, so building source and checking that feature’s operation took long, and since the problem area was a module handling API communication with the server, I had to test all core features using that module. Plus, the build process suddenly went haywire while fixing it and other problems cascaded, so fix time kept increasing.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/e67a8/vietnam_commit.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 48.12500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"vietnam commit\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/6af66/vietnam_commit.png\" srcset=\"/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/69538/vietnam_commit.png 160w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/72799/vietnam_commit.png 320w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/6af66/vietnam_commit.png 640w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/d9199/vietnam_commit.png 960w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/21b4d/vietnam_commit.png 1280w,\n/static/1ec95d12d2fb2770a8c661464bc589a6/e67a8/vietnam_commit.png 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Nostalgic commits from that day</small>\n</center>\n<p>Ultimately various issues overlapped and the final release could only happen past 5am.

Of course, since this person’s major wasn’t this field and they had almost no experience doing product-related work, they were no different from a newcomer.</p>\n<p>Then as teams were divided into squad formations, this person and I came to work together in the same squad - when first working together I honestly didn’t pay much attention to them. Like they’ll do well on their own… or even if they don’t, I or someone can cover? That level.</p>\n<p>But working together I saw many new aspects of this person I didn’t know before. Though they had less experience than others, they were extremely passionate about making products, and also asked many questions - the quality of questions was quite good. Maybe that’s why, every time this person asked me development questions, I gradually taught with more enthusiasm, and this person always thanked me a lot for that.</p>\n<p>I also felt really good seeing that person grow quickly as I taught them knowledge I knew. I think I first thought then that knowledge I already knew and thought was nothing much could be tremendous help to others.</p>\n<p>And that person’s squad operation style was participatory where developers and designers all freely suggest ideas and they aggregate and organize them while proceeding - as that person’s experience and skills accumulated, synergy effects occurred so the team’s productivity increased and I remember the team’s morale and atmosphere being very good. Ultimately, my action of teaching that person development knowledge affected not just me and that person but the entire team.</p>\n<p>Going through such processes, I no longer agreed with thoughts like “if individuals each do well, the team runs well on its own.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"from-loner-to-somewhat-social\" style=\"position:relative;\">From Loner to Somewhat Social<a href=\"#from-loner-to-somewhat-social\" aria-label=\"from loner to somewhat social permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I originally didn’t like meeting people much. But going through many things at this job, my personality kind of changed…? I suddenly started acting social.</p>\n<p>When I first joined, there was a backend developer who joined within a few days of me - for about a month after joining we barely talked besides work because I had no interest in people. <small>(This person was also shy so neither of us talked much)</small></p>\n<p>But now when someone new joins I talk to them first and drink or play games with other teams, acting social - thinking about it now, last year’s burnout was probably the catalyst.</p>\n<p>I experienced severe burnout around summer 2018 - until then I was someone who coded every single day of the year, 365 days. On weekdays I worked overtime until 11pm, came home and did toy projects until 2-3am, on weekends I did other toy projects with friends - that kind of period. I probably coded at least 7 hours every day all week like that.</p>\n<p>I’d lived this way continuously since 2014 when I returned to university after military discharge, so by 2018 when burnout came I’d lived like that for about 5 years. Then burnout suddenly hit - I just lost interest in coding itself and didn’t want to do anything.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/7f15f/contributions.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA3UlEQVR42iWPyW6EQAxE+f9fyyW3iTJZJMIEhrXbvUDTwIshlixL5SqXqzgOmJOQ1oWoc06elFZy3vGLZV6jttBJzRRrQjK6T/hrZuWtqgmkvLAfO0VKC0/7poIHrS0ZXMMoDeIcne2Z3MDka+7NK5/9i3IqxAu9GowilOM7xivPN2x7ojgdnnqglhuN3On9FxIMzkdc8EocaaWidZUa1DRjS4gJ682FP+wHo/tVzcRZxaLRfoylc4bBB/32jL1x7Ad50+h7Zs5Oo0b94B/fNm3Fz/gSe76nG2VfXrs/IVEyreqgrgEAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"contributions\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/6af66/contributions.png\" srcset=\"/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/69538/contributions.png 160w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/72799/contributions.png 320w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/6af66/contributions.png 640w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/d9199/contributions.png 960w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/21b4d/contributions.png 1280w,\n/static/d35831406969526b9dd2ed48ac0e03b8/7f15f/contributions.png 1530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>My sparse 2018 GitHub contributions</small>\n</center>\n<p>Even thinking about it now, it was an extremely bewildering emotion. Someone who coded 7-8 hours every day for 5 years because coding was so fun and enjoyable suddenly hating coding overnight is quite a strange feeling. I felt skepticism like “why do I need to struggle this hard?” and simultaneously felt anxiety like “am I falling behind?” I think I also thought “maybe development doesn’t suit me?”</p>\n<p>What I did wrong at this time was showing too obviously that I didn’t want to work. My inner thoughts then were “ah, it’s so boring and hard. Should I quit the company…?” so I distanced myself from team members and my work attitude was poor. During the day I worked half-heartedly and finished work by working overtime alone, so work didn’t pile up, but I couldn’t communicate much with team members.</p>\n<p>Hearing about it later, team members who’d worked with me long thought “this guy suddenly went weird…?” and approached me first, but other team members who didn’t know me well apparently thought I wasn’t working properly. So the team leader asked for tea time and we talked briefly - what that person said then still remains in my memory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Evan’s hardship isn’t Evan’s personal problem but the team’s problem. The team will help as much as possible.</p>\n<p>But you need to tell us what’s making it hard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hearing this, I wasn’t exactly moved but freshly thought again “right. We’re a team.” So from then I explained my current situation to people around me and could hear much advice - everyone around me said exactly the same thing: “rest a bit.”</p>\n<p>The life of working overtime daily, coding on weekends, having no hobbies and not dating made me exhausted. This fatigue tends to build up sneakily then explode bang! when passing some threshold, and now was exactly that timing. So everyone advised me to rest while doing other things besides coding.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/6a068/hwan.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 96.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"hwan\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/c08c5/hwan.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/0913d/hwan.jpg 160w,\n/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/cb69c/hwan.jpg 320w,\n/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/c08c5/hwan.jpg 640w,\n/static/297c425f303ec54bca9a42de3c3151a7/6a068/hwan.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>People around me told me things like this regularly</small>\n</center>\n<p>So I lived a debauched life by my standards to relieve stress - drinking, playing pool, going to karaoke almost daily - and I could become close with people from teams besides the development team.

But the ideas they casually toss out are so novel they can solve problems immediately.</p>\n<p>Of course, these ideas couldn’t come without deep understanding of JavaScript, and seeing this person solve in one shot a problem I’d pondered for a week just two days after joining made me think again “there really are many experts in the world.”</p>\n<p>It was a kind of timing issue where I couldn’t know when external SDK script loading finished, so the global variable holding that SDK was <code class=\"language-text\">null</code> during application initialization - I’d barely gotten it working with <code class=\"language-text\">setTimeout</code> and had no more ideas so left it alone. But this person saw this problem and immediately solved it by declaring an <code class=\"language-text\">isLoaded</code> variable as a <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> and resolving that promise when external SDK loading finished. <small>(Even now thinking about it, it’s a perverted but novel method.)</small></p>\n<p>And this person also solved the memory leak in the frontend render server I wrote with Express - I’d improved this problem several times so it was fine for now, but leaks themselves still occurred bit by bit. Meanwhile, when this senior updated external packages used in frontend, the memory leak suddenly accelerated. But I couldn’t identify this problem’s fundamental cause. So this person took this issue and decided to fix it, and I remember being quite surprised they solved the problem faster than expected.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/22475/leak_fix.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 37.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABHUlEQVR42p2P3U7CQBCF+/5voAmGGBPDhRcmvoHRRMXQQC2KUNpSaIF2oWjLT2k/h4YYrxSc5GRPZs5+u6P50YKpEoUx2XLFsZVlmdwN2SRzEuWjFduM7TQie+1itXoky43ECoriMOV5XmrHId8KUF748Mbc3LWpNZ1vYF4cDt1V6eUsgZblc6Lb1NoenyWQo4A/pd27EdXWgOqLy6UxIE7/Bv4202rvY87MIeemy4XhMkvW+xX4V2lX1oSK6VExHE51h26UEK82zOSnStYP0zXBYslQ1FMJ5mRBw48xxguceYotvb5KiSQ/k7x22/G5fnJ4dkOaXkC952GOIjqBoiG+YQe0Roq67fPYH6EPQ3SZP4jf9Zr+fibZt0DxBSoiZHLOHyBEAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"leak fix\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/6af66/leak_fix.png\" srcset=\"/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/69538/leak_fix.png 160w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/72799/leak_fix.png 320w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/6af66/leak_fix.png 640w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/d9199/leak_fix.png 960w,\n/static/51c26b7dc9828c24efdf3695a5df7ca6/22475/leak_fix.png 1039w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Dramatic change in transaction time</small>\n</center>\n<p>It was a leak occurring when some external packages designed to only be usable on the client were used during server-side rendering timing - I hadn’t even thought of this case as a possibility.</p>\n<p>Besides that, I was also positively influenced a lot by a backend developer I worked with long regarding design and perspectives on business, and learned passion for products from a mobile developer who likes working overtime.

Actually besides college general education reports, a few blog posts, and company technical documentation, I’d never written anything.

(Seems like one spy snuck in but let's ignore it.)</small>\n</center>\n<p>So why did I write a book? Well, there are various reasons but narrowing down to a few, roughly this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to make tangible work that I can hold and see, not intangible work like code.</li>\n<li>While writing a book, couldn’t I organize knowledge I vaguely know?</li>\n<li>More people than expected were starting to learn coding through books.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I said I’m writing a book, some people occasionally cracked jokes like “Wow, Evan! Now you’ll make money from books too?” but I didn’t expect much because I thought from the start that money you can make selling books isn’t that much.</p>\n<p>Rather, for me the book’s appeal was less about side income and more about my own satisfaction of having written a book and being able to share what I know with others.</p>\n<p>It’s the same with this blog - honestly how much would I make from this blog? From the start my posts aren’t content the general public can consume. So even if the blog really takes off, making at most 1 million won per month would be a lot.</p>\n<p>Of course 1 million won isn’t small money, but it’s not life-changing money either so I think it’s meaningless. So I’m just running the blog wanting to share my thoughts and knowledge with others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wanting-to-make-tangible-work\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wanting to Make Tangible Work<a href=\"#wanting-to-make-tangible-work\" aria-label=\"wanting to make tangible work permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Being a developer, I make programs daily. But programs feel more abstract than like real existing objects. Like intangible conceptual things you can’t touch with hands or smell.</p>\n<p>But when I think of books, the image that immediately comes up is a synesthetic image with various senses together - paper smell when opening new books, texture felt when taking books from bookshelves, sounds heard when turning pages one by one - so it felt very different from making programs. That the output comes as shaped objects rather than mechanical something felt very new.</p>\n<p>And crucially, I’m a Kyobo Bookstore fanboy who went to Gwanghwamun Kyobo Bookstore extremely often holding Grandpa’s hand since age 5. Imagining my book displayed at Gwanghwamun Kyobo Bookstore with such memories felt somehow touching and strange.</p>\n<h3 id=\"organizing-my-knowledge-while-writing\" style=\"position:relative;\">Organizing My Knowledge While Writing<a href=\"#organizing-my-knowledge-while-writing\" aria-label=\"organizing my knowledge while writing permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Though I wrote a book about Vue, I obviously didn’t start writing knowing everything about Vue perfectly. Of course having 2 years’ experience using Vue makes me familiar, but being familiar doesn’t lead to being good.</p>\n<p>So I re-studied Vue from basics thinking I’m studying it again, re-reading from official docs. Looking closely, this is similar to blog posting - for example, if writing about Vue’s lifecycle, naturally most people research. Because I can’t be sure what I know is correct. In this sense, the burden felt from unspecified people reading my writing seems similar whether books or blogs.</p>\n<p>Plus, I actually never separately studied Vue. I just joined a company and that company had already adopted Vue, so I started using Vue, and after that I just looked up what I needed while developing business. <small>(So components I wrote early after joining are complete disasters.)</small></p>\n<p>For such reasons, I thought “since it came to this, let’s properly solidify my VueJS knowledge.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-people-than-expected-were-starting-coding-through-books\" style=\"position:relative;\">More People Than Expected Were Starting Coding Through Books<a href=\"#more-people-than-expected-were-starting-coding-through-books\" aria-label=\"more people than expected were starting coding through books permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, I’m someone who thinks “studying is more convenient with internet than books!” so I was skeptical about tech books. So when my friend first proposed co-authoring, writing the book itself felt somewhat meaningless and I said “who studies from books these days? Everyone searches on internet,” but that friend’s response was exactly this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dude, for people studying for the first time, it might even be hard to know what keywords to search for on the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hearing this, I immediately realized my thinking was quite short. Somewhere I read “humans unconsciously try to project themselves onto others,” and that was exactly me.</p>\n<p>Because I was always comfortable studying from internet, I naturally thought others would be too, but I forgot that basically studying from internet requires the premise of knowing what keywords to Google to get the information I want.</p>\n<p>Naturally, people first encountering development or unfamiliar with Googling can feel entry barriers in this regard, but I wasn’t thinking about that. So hearing that friend’s words, I thought:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might be better to build capability to Google alone after studying through books with relatively lower entry barriers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, obviously reading one book won’t suddenly make someone an absolute Vue master, but at least after reading the book and understanding overall content, I wanted to help readers gain ability to find keywords alone and Google and study more about what they want to know more.</p>\n<p>Besides these, there were other reasons like writing one more line on resumes or “being an author is kinda cool…?” plus altruistic reasons like “contributing a bit to developers’ ecosystem,” but the representative reasons greatly affecting my motivation were those three above. Ultimately after pondering, in late August 2018, I took my friend’s hand and entered the difficult path.</p>\n<h2 id=\"before-writing-the-book\" style=\"position:relative;\">Before Writing the Book<a href=\"#before-writing-the-book\" aria-label=\"before writing the book permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After co-authoring with my friend was decided, we first had a brief meeting with a publishing company employee at a cafe near Yeoksam Station. The content was roughly simple things like send us a writing plan, how royalties come out, how contracts will proceed.</p>\n<p>Until then my friend and I had only talked roughly about “we should write this and that content,” but now we had to discuss details to write the writing plan to send the publishing company. The key point among several things agreed then was “when readers finish this book, they should at least be able to develop applications when joining companies.”</p>\n<p>This came after reading several other Vue books currently on the market. Books being sold mainly explained APIs or technology principles focusing on that technology, and examples also tended to make simple To Do lists or small applications with similar architectures.</p>\n<p>The disappointing point my friend and I felt reading such books was “after reading this, can you work if immediately deployed to actual work?”</p>\n<p>No matter how much you learned through books what Vue APIs exist, what order lifecycle executes in, problems new developers face after joining companies aren’t simple problems like “which lifecycle should I put this logic in?” but higher-level problems like “what units should I divide components into?”, “Should API communication logic be in components? Or in Vuex store?”, “How should I manage logged-in user state?”</p>\n<p>So I thought it would be success just making readers think “Huh, I tried something similar to this once?” when encountering those problems at companies after writing this book’s examples once, and my friend thought identically, so deciding the book’s big direction wasn’t difficult.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 484px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/ff42b/plans.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 97.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"plans\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/ff42b/plans.png\" srcset=\"/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/69538/plans.png 160w,\n/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/72799/plans.png 320w,\n/static/b3c3597b655396c4c38d530c43a47da5/ff42b/plans.png 484w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Scene reminding me of some meme seen somewhere</small>\n</center>\n<p>After the book’s big direction was decided, my friend and I definitely met once or twice weekly after work, went to nearby cafes, and started writing the writing plan together. The writing plan includes roughly this information:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Title (tentative)</li>\n<li>Author</li>\n<li>Writing date</li>\n<li>Book’s core concept</li>\n<li>Content summary and features</li>\n<li>Trends of technology related to this book</li>\n<li>Expected completion date</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are more pieces of information but the big framework is roughly this. Since the writing plan written then is also material the publishing company uses when promoting the book later, it’s good to write as detailed as possible.</p>\n<p>Anyway, after writing and submitting the writing plan as the publishing company requested, we started full-scale writing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-write-like-developers\" style=\"position:relative;\">Let’s Write Like Developers!<a href=\"#lets-write-like-developers\" aria-label=\"lets write like developers permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>At first we started writing using Google Docs. Google Docs provides font style features like H1, H2, so we could write documents setting styles agreed beforehand. But when we wrote about 3 chapters with Google Docs, I started thinking Google Docs was quite unproductive.</p>\n<p>When changing fonts or attaching images, having to position the cursor at the part to change then click menus with mouse felt too cumbersome, and concentration flow broke each time. Plus, having to set font styles to publishing company standards every time creating new documents for each chapter also lowered productivity.</p>\n<p>And my friend and I reviewed parts each other wrote by leaving comments on Google Docs documents to catch missed parts or unify writing style. However I thought this method was a bit unproductive - from the reviewer’s perspective it was hard to know what content was added this time, what content was deleted, and from the review receiver’s perspective it was hard to see at a glance where in the document comments were left.</p>\n<p>So I started pondering “how can I focus only on writing without spending time on actions other than writing?”</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-books-using-markdown\" style=\"position:relative;\">Writing Books Using Markdown<a href=\"#writing-books-using-markdown\" aria-label=\"writing books using markdown permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>What I chose as a result of my pondering was the Markdown format. Since both my friend and I are developers, first Markdown format was a very familiar format to us, and the document’s overall style was already decided, so it seemed I could keep focusing only on writing without worrying about style or doing separate work.</p>\n<p>But since publishing companies manage manuscripts using MS Word, ultimately when sending manuscripts to publishing companies we had to send docx files, and when receiving book reviews from other reviewers we had to send pdf files. So I had to find ways to convert Markdown files to docx or pdf files.</p>\n<p>So I found libraries called <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pandoc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">markdown-pdf</a>. <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code> supports converting various format documents enough to advertise on its homepage as Universal Document Converter. Of course it also supports converting Markdown to docx. But since it doesn’t support converting Markdown to pdf, I had to find other libraries to implement that feature, during which I found the <code class=\"language-text\">markdown-pdf</code> library.</p>\n<p>After finishing research up to here, I proposed to my friend to switch from Google Docs to Markdown, and my friend accepted after pondering, so after that all book writing proceeded using Markdown and Git.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-managing-documents-using-git\" style=\"position:relative;\">Version Managing Documents Using Git<a href=\"#version-managing-documents-using-git\" aria-label=\"version managing documents using git permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Another problem when using Google Docs was difficulty managing document versions. Of course Google Docs also lets you check content added or deleted in each version by entering the <code class=\"language-text\">File > Version history</code> menu, but the disadvantage is the version isn’t clearly what units they’re grouped by.</p>\n<p>But using Git, when committing you can divide into meaningful units and write accurate commit messages to inform the other person exactly which parts of the document were modified. Also, after writing certain units of documents, you can have the other person review through Pull Requests, ensuring at least one review of parts each wrote.</p>\n<p>So my friend and I created a repository on Github and proceeded with writing taking one chapter at a time, but agreed to always send Pull Requests and merge when wanting to merge content to master branch, and as a result we could proceed with writing without great difficulty understanding content even if not parts each wrote.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6569d/review.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 69.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"review\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6af66/review.png\" srcset=\"/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/69538/review.png 160w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/72799/review.png 320w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6af66/review.png 640w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/d9199/review.png 960w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/21b4d/review.png 1280w,\n/static/4ab6fb78bbb128bf0fd837c9b548a5ae/6569d/review.png 1328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Benefits of reviewing.jpg</small>\n</center>\n<p>Of course, when doing full reviews later there were many parts to fix at once so we struggled a bit with Merge Conflicts, but if we’d proceeded with Google Docs, there was high possibility of passing without knowing where two people simultaneously modified.</p>\n<h3 id=\"converting-documents\" style=\"position:relative;\">Converting Documents<a href=\"#converting-documents\" aria-label=\"converting documents permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Documents written like this were partially published converted to PDF at intervals.

but later when converting to docx format through <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code>, issues related to font styles occurred.</p>\n<p>When converting to docx format using <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code>, you can set what’s called a reference document - if you set custom font styles in this document, it makes converted documents using the same font styles referring to this document’s font styles.</p>\n<p>So at first just trusting this feature I thought “I just need to make one reference document with font styles set according to publishing company format,” but when actually running scripts using the reference document option, code block styles attached to documents went haywire.</p>\n<p>So ultimately when finally sending manuscripts to the publishing company, I used the method of converting md format to docx format’s default font styles using <code class=\"language-text\">pandoc</code>, then manually changing that document’s font styles by hand.</p>\n<p>Well, I struggled quite a bit at the end, but still by choosing md format I could save lots of time during the writing process, plus I could version manage using Git, so overall I think it was a good choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conflicts-during-co-authoring\" style=\"position:relative;\">Conflicts During Co-authoring<a href=\"#conflicts-during-co-authoring\" aria-label=\"conflicts

co-authored with my friend, communication to align opinions and draw consensus was also one very important task.</p>\n<p>Actually my friend and I had experience proceeding with side projects together and usually got along quite well, so we’re close friends who even went on overseas trips together. But due to book media characteristics where unlike code it’s impossible to modify after deployment, the desire to “finish as perfectly as possible” made aligning opinions more difficult than usual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"different-perspectives-on-design\" style=\"position:relative;\">Different Perspectives on Design<a href=\"#different-perspectives-on-design\" aria-label=\"different perspectives on design permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>What caused many opinion conflicts initially was example application design. Since examples going into books are information exposed to unspecified people, they should be written using widely applicable knowledge excluding subjectivity as much as possible. So my friend and I talked tremendously about “how should we take example application design?”</p>\n<p>Simply from component naming and project directory structure to deep topics like which component should Dispatch actions for store state changes - we talked about various things. Ultimately only after drawing consensus through such endless communication could we enter example application development.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/077b7/meeting.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 79.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"meeting\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/6af66/meeting.png\" srcset=\"/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/69538/meeting.png 160w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/72799/meeting.png 320w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/6af66/meeting.png 640w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/d9199/meeting.png 960w,\n/static/b0843883f37a5a8955d1b73bfc9d2333/077b7/meeting.png 1166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>We decided everything from Form component definition to what libraries to use.</small>\n</center>\n<h3 id=\"different-working-styles\" style=\"position:relative;\">Different Working Styles<a href=\"#different-working-styles\" aria-label=\"different working styles permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Second was working styles. Actually this was a really unexpected part - I already had experience proceeding with side projects with this friend, and even during opinion conflicts we came to very mutually satisfying conclusions proceeding, so I thought this time would be the same. But whether because this was paid work or had deadlines, situations very different from side projects unfolded.</p>\n<p>First, I’m not the style chased by deadlines doing any work. I can do this because I minimize variables arising during work and completely block work that seems risky. And crucially my personality is somewhat relaxed. To put it nicely relaxed, badly lazy - well anyway that kind of personality.</p>\n<p>But this friend has incredible passion whatever they do. Whether work they don’t want to do or want to do, always doing their best. I think this friend can do this because basically they have a personality with great sense of responsibility. <small>(Well might not be. Even friends have unknown parts)</small></p>\n<p>Exactly these parts about this friend greatly stimulate me, and even thinking developer to developer excluding the friend part, I think they’re a very good developer.</p>\n<p>But doing work with deadlines together, from this friend’s perspective it seemed I wasn’t actively participating, and I had thoughts like “this isn’t work to stress this much about…” And being human, as deadlines approached we inevitably felt anxiety like “what if we can’t keep promises with the publishing company,” and both working at companies had to do company work separately. So I think physical and mental fatigue accumulated.</p>\n<p>Still fortunately, the biggest commonality between this friend and me was knowing the importance of soft skills like communication.

But my friend had richer connections and better social skills than me, so had many people to ask reviews. <small>(Amazing…)</small> For such reasons, book reviews were work I couldn’t do alone and really thanks to my friend.

So at first I pondered tremendously about “what should I do for study members…?” but once the study started I knew such worry was my groundless fear.</p>\n<p>All study applicants passionately asked questions first and clearly expressed opinions about parts wanting to know more, so I could proceed with the study comfortably. And everyone had good personalities so even shy me could fit in well.</p>\n<p>While writing the book, receiving feedback from study members who were actual target readers and modifying the book somehow gave me confidence about the book, and seeing them learn smoothly studying with the book I wrote, I felt somewhat proud.</p>\n<p>Actually I didn’t have desire to proactively share knowledge with others first, but writing books this time and running studies, seeing knowledge I thought was nothing much greatly helping others, I became a bit interested in education and my shyness improved a bit. <small>(Still the path to social butterfly is long and tough…)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"working-developers-reviews\" style=\"position:relative;\">Working Developers’ Reviews<a href=\"#working-developers-reviews\" aria-label=\"working developers reviews permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>After finishing writing the book, I also asked surrounding working developers for reviews - such people are called beta readers apparently. I first learned this time.</p>\n<p>Beta readers proceeded divided into full reviews and chapter reviews according to their free time, and they gave really meticulous feedback like revisiting parts I missed while writing and pointing out explanations that might be hard to understand, so it was very reassuring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Actually at first I started with the complacent mind “book? Just feels like a slightly long post,” but soon realized that wasn’t it. Though not written in this post, making example applications was also no joke - the problem was when modifying example applications, I had to find the same parts in the book and modify code blocks and change code explanations accordingly. <small>(Plus had to make 2 client applications and API server.)</small></p>\n<p>Even if example applications and book content synced slightly off, readers could feel considerable confusion, so I had to meticulously check such parts - I think this was hardest.</p>\n<p>And unlike posts, books are media requiring very long breath for one topic, so front content and back content concepts shouldn’t differ, but since I never wrote such long texts, I had to periodically check front content and writing style while writing.</p>\n<p>Still, after writing a book like this I feel proud and became much used to writing, so posting once or twice weekly isn’t very difficult, so overall it’s a good feeling. I hope many prospective readers reading this book feel it was beneficial. Especially I hope people starting frontend development for the first time read this book and think “Huh what, it’s not much?”</p>\n<p>And finally, I want to give <strong>overwhelming thanks</strong> to beta readers who spared busy personal time reviewing the book and developer Kim Younghoon who proposed the good opportunity of technical book writing.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/4b190/thanks.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 86.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"thanks\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/c08c5/thanks.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/0913d/thanks.jpg 160w,\n/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/cb69c/thanks.jpg 320w,\n/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/c08c5/thanks.jpg 640w,\n/static/4ac69e39a60e61a01bddd4634b5d04ee/4b190/thanks.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <br>\n</center>\n<p>By the way, my book can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/76639545\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yes24</a>, but since first edition printing hasn’t finished yet, delivery is possible from next month.</p>\n<p>But rather than buying books online, I want to recommend going to offline bookstores like Kyobo Bookstore when the book stocks later, reading once, and buying.
