When exceptional people come together and work side by side, organizational excellence follows. And indeed, the Toss frontend chapter has many outstanding developers who quickly grasp complex problems, craft elegant solutions, and help each other grow.</p>\n<p>When leading a small organization, you can build excellence by establishing clear technical and cultural hiring standards and focusing on collecting exceptional talent. That’s why at my previous company, I remember pouring the most energy into hiring.</p>\n<p>But the Toss frontend chapter is a large organization — around 250 people across the broader community, with nearly 140 in the Toss Core frontend chapter where I work. Leading an organization this large requires a different approach than leading a small one.</p>\n<p>At this scale, simply gathering excellent individuals isn’t enough. With more diverse people joining, the organization needs significantly more energy to understand each person’s strengths and capabilities and make sound decisions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"from-10-to-140-the-need-for-systems\" style=\"position:relative;\">From 10 to 140: The Need for Systems<a href=\"#from-10-to-140-the-need-for-systems\" aria-label=\"from 10 to 140 the need for systems permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Back when the frontend chapter had around 10 people, everyone could know each other in detail — faces, names, personalities.</p>\n<p>But when I returned to Toss, the frontend chapter had already grown into a massive organization compared to before.</p>\n<p>Even within the same chapter, there are cases where people don’t know who else is on the team. If you’re not actively paying attention, you might not even notice when new hires join. The rules of the game are simply different with 10 people versus 140.</p>\n<p>Even a chapter lead, without making a deliberate effort, would find it extremely difficult to understand this many people’s strengths, growth trajectories, and motivations. Right now, individual effort from leads still covers things to some degree, but if the headcount keeps growing, there will inevitably come a point where even that becomes impossible.</p>\n<p>Information about individuals would fragment across the minds of multiple leads, and depending on who interacts with which lead, some people would naturally become more visible while others fade into the background.</p>\n<p>That’s why I came to think that the lead’s role in this game needs to shift: from “directly caring for people” to “building systems that make the organization excellent on its own.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"spin-the-flywheel-that-creates-organizational-excellence\" style=\"position:relative;\">Spin the Flywheel That Creates Organizational Excellence<a href=\"#spin-the-flywheel-that-creates-organizational-excellence\" aria-label=\"spin the flywheel that creates organizational excellence permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As I mentioned, the key to building an excellent organization is designing one that naturally gravitates toward excellence on its own. This is similar to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flywheel effect</a> borrowed from product development.</p>\n<p>The flywheel effect describes a structure where small, repeated impacts accumulate to produce increasingly larger outcomes. It requires a lot of energy at first, but once it starts spinning, momentum allows it to generate bigger results with less effort.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in organizational management, when individual activities connect into a virtuous cycle, excellence naturally accelerates.</p>\n<p>The flywheel I’ve designed for an excellent organization consists of six stages:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Recruit</strong>: Gather exceptional talent obsessed with growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: Understand the organization’s expectations and your current state.</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity</strong>: Give prepared talent chances to experience growth in small increments.</li>\n<li><strong>Recognition</strong>: Deliver tangible and psychological rewards to those who’ve grown.</li>\n<li><strong>Contribution</strong>: People with positive experiences participate in chapter activities, making the organization more excellent.</li>\n<li><strong>Branding</strong>: Organize and share the chapter’s work externally.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"stage-1-recruit--gather-exceptional-talent-obsessed-with-growth\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 1: Recruit — Gather Exceptional Talent Obsessed with Growth<a href=\"#stage-1-recruit--gather-exceptional-talent-obsessed-with-growth\" aria-label=\"stage 1 recruit  gather exceptional talent obsessed with growth permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Building an excellent organization requires a continuous inflow of exceptional talent. The important thing here isn’t simply finding skilled people, but people who are obsessed with growth and have high growth potential.</p>\n<p>Identifying these people during the hiring process matters, but what matters even more is branding that makes people on the outside think, “If I go there, I can grow even more” — naturally driving more applications to Toss.</p>\n<p>We need to concretely show what technical capabilities the Toss frontend chapter has and what kind of culture it fosters. This is exactly where Stage 6 (Branding) connects back to Stage 1 (Recruit).</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-2-self-awareness--view-organizational-expectations-and-personal-strengths-through-a-shared-language\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 2: Self-awareness — View Organizational Expectations and Personal Strengths Through a Shared Language<a href=\"#stage-2-self-awareness--view-organizational-expectations-and-personal-strengths-through-a-shared-language\" aria-label=\"stage 2 self awareness  view organizational expectations and personal strengths through a shared language permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I believe growth always starts with self-awareness. So the growth that an excellent organization produces ultimately begins with how accurately each member recognizes their own capabilities and strengths.</p>\n<p>It’s similar to a strategy game. Think of Lü Bu and Zhuge Liang from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Both are exceptional talents, but the moment they’re given mismatched roles, their excellence vanishes. Assigning Lü Bu to domestic administration or sending Zhuge Liang into single combat would obviously produce poor results.</p>\n<p>The problem is that in reality, people often don’t know whether they’re a Lü Bu or a Zhuge Liang — or they might be a Lü Bu who says they want to do administration. I think this is less about willpower and more about a lack of self-awareness.</p>\n<p>That’s why I believe the first step toward growth in an excellent organization is helping members accurately recognize their own capabilities and strengths, then connecting them with the right growth opportunities.</p>\n<p>Along these lines, the Toss frontend chapter uses a tool called the Skill Tree. Rather than a device for defining excellence, it’s more like a reference line that helps members see their current capabilities and strengths more clearly, and articulate their next growth direction for themselves.</p>\n<p>Once someone can articulate their growth direction and strengths, leads use this information to coach them so their strengths translate into real outcomes and growth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-3-opportunity--let-people-experience-growth-in-small-increments\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 3: Opportunity — Let People Experience Growth in Small Increments<a href=\"#stage-3-opportunity--let-people-experience-growth-in-small-increments\" aria-label=\"stage 3 opportunity  let people experience growth in small increments permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Once self-awareness is established, what the organization needs to do next is clear: provide opportunities for members to take on challenges without pressure and experience small wins. No matter how well someone understands their strengths and current state, growth remains theoretical without a real arena to try things in.</p>\n<p>This conviction became sharper through a recent leadership survey. The results showed that interest in leadership roles was far greater than expected. However, a common response was: “I’m interested, but I don’t feel ready yet.”</p>\n<p>At first, I assumed members felt their capabilities were lacking. But looking at individual responses more closely, it was closer to “I don’t know what I should be preparing for or what capabilities I need to build.” The chapter wasn’t providing enough hints about the direction and methods of growth.</p>\n<p>So I decided we needed to create more of these opportunities and expose them more frequently. Growth isn’t built from a single giant leap — it’s built on many small wins. We need to create an environment where chapter members can take on challenges without hesitation.</p>\n<p>This problem awareness led to the creation of the Next F-Lead program. This program focuses on three core competencies: strategic thinking, interview skills, and 1-on-1 coaching. The goal isn’t to suddenly turn someone into a lead — it’s to let them experience the F-Lead role in small doses beforehand. Through this, members come to see leadership not as “something far removed from me” but as “a next step I can gradually prepare for.”</p>\n<p>Beyond Next F-Lead, we’re working to help members envision their next steps more clearly through various education and experience programs. The key isn’t pushing anyone in a specific direction — it’s creating an environment where each person can try things and choose for themselves.</p>\n<p>Someone who has experienced small wins can imagine bigger challenges, and that imagination translates into real action toward the next stage of growth. That’s why the Opportunity stage is so important in the flywheel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-4-recognition--let-people-experience-achievement-through-tangible-and-psychological-rewards\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 4: Recognition — Let People Experience Achievement Through Tangible and Psychological Rewards<a href=\"#stage-4-recognition--let-people-experience-achievement-through-tangible-and-psychological-rewards\" aria-label=\"stage 4 recognition  let people experience achievement through tangible and psychological rewards permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Growth isn’t completed by experience alone. Recognition must follow for those who’ve produced growth. Positive feedback as a reward is easily underestimated in organizational management, but it’s one of the most important elements for re-accelerating the flywheel.</p>\n<p>Within the Toss frontend chapter, there are already many people contributing to the organization by showing their strengths — people who consistently share technical knowledge, participate in activities like the Open Source Committee or Code Quality Committee, or build and share tools that help colleagues work better.</p>\n<p>These contributions elevate the organization, but if their value isn’t made visible enough, even the contributors themselves may struggle to feel their own achievements. That’s why I believe these people need to be recognized more often and more clearly.</p>\n<p>The same goes for people in lead roles. They don’t just deliver their own results — they help colleagues grow right beside them. From the organization’s perspective, it’s an extremely important role. From the individual’s perspective, it’s no light responsibility. There’s a lot to do and a lot to think about. For me, every day working alongside these people is filled with gratitude, and their dedication absolutely deserves to be rewarded.</p>\n<p>That’s why the Toss frontend chapter is preparing a dedicated leadership education program for leads. Beyond just training, we’re also planning opportunities for deeper participation in chapter decision-making, along with explicit expansion of authority and roles. This isn’t just a reward — it’s a clear message: “The organization takes your growth seriously.”</p>\n<p>Recognition isn’t the end of achievement. It’s the signal that starts the next phase of growth. Someone who has experienced accomplishment naturally wants to contribute again, and that contribution makes the organization more excellent once more. That’s why the Recognition stage can’t be left out of the flywheel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-5-contribution--positive-experiences-make-the-organization-excellent\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 5: Contribution — Positive Experiences Make the Organization Excellent<a href=\"#stage-5-contribution--positive-experiences-make-the-organization-excellent\" aria-label=\"stage 5 contribution  positive experiences make the organization excellent permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>People who’ve been recognized and experienced achievement naturally start contributing to the organization. And when these contributions are met with the recognition mentioned in Stage 4 — shout-outs, expanded authority, participation in decision-making — the behavior is naturally reinforced. This is the core of the flywheel.</p>\n<p>I believe an organization becomes excellent when knowledge sharing and vigorous debate appear frequently. These are what contribution looks like, and these contributions collectively make an organization excellent.</p>\n<p>The Toss frontend chapter has a long history of such contributions.</p>\n<p>In the early days when the team was small, efforts like building internal libraries, developing TDS (Toss Design System), and creating admin tools were all driven by this kind of contribution. Now it takes the form of technical tool and knowledge sharing, the Open Source Committee, the Code Quality Committee, Frontend Accelerator mentoring, user accessibility improvements, and more.</p>\n<p>Leads who completed Next F-Lead improve the program.

Should we unconditionally respect every kind of diversity? When an individual’s choices clash with the organization’s goals, what criteria should a leader use to make decisions?</p>\n<p>In this post, I want to share a specific dilemma I faced while working as a chapter lead in a frontend organization of about 100 people, and the wisdom I found within the limits of respecting diversity.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I’ll explore how Buddhist philosophy, particularly dependent origination and the Middle Way, can offer practical insights for running modern organizations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-the-dilemma-begins\" style=\"position:relative;\">Where the dilemma begins<a href=\"#where-the-dilemma-begins\" aria-label=\"where the dilemma begins permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As a leader striving to build an excellent organization, I need to support and encourage my team members’ growth. But with 100 people in the group, there are inevitably those who think differently.</p>\n<p>Recently, one team member sent me into deep contemplation. They had outstanding technical skills, executed their current responsibilities flawlessly, and earned the trust of their colleagues. From my perspective, they’d be a perfect fit for a lead role. But they declined any such additional responsibility.</p>\n<p>Whenever I suggested new challenges for their growth, they would calmly respond:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’m not really thinking about that right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather focus on other things.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If they had been underperforming while also refusing to grow, it would have been a clear-cut problem. But the fact that they were already doing excellent work made it all the more ambiguous.</p>\n<p>This experience raised fundamental questions for me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Is it right to set higher goals for someone who’s already doing well enough?”</p>\n<p>And: “How far should the principle of respecting individual diversity and choice extend?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m sure many of you have wrestled with similar dilemmas. Facing this kind of situation, we tend to oscillate between two extremes: “We must unconditionally respect diversity” on one side, and “The organization’s goals require uniformity” on the other.</p>\n<p>Through this experience, I realized I needed a perspective beyond these binary choices. What traps might be hiding within the notion of “respecting diversity” that we so readily take for granted?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-trap-of-respecting-diversity\" style=\"position:relative;\">The trap of respecting diversity<a href=\"#the-trap-of-respecting-diversity\" aria-label=\"the trap of respecting diversity permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As I dug deeper into this issue, I realized that diversity is often approached in a binary way — people tend to simply divide it into either respecting diversity or not.</p>\n<p>But reality isn’t that simple. Respecting diversity isn’t an absolute principle; it should be approached as a question of how much an organization or society can accommodate given its specific characteristics.</p>\n<p>This connects to the truth revealed by the Buddhist concept of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda). Because all phenomena exist in mutual dependence, neither absolute freedom nor absolute control is possible. <small>(I know bringing up Buddhism out of nowhere might seem surprising, but the stories from Buddhist teachings actually offer a great deal of life wisdom.)</small></p>\n<p>Take the South Korean constitution as an example. South Korea is a democracy that guarantees its citizens’ freedom, yet Article 8 of the constitution allows for the dissolution of political parties under certain conditions. This means that when elements threaten the basic democratic order, freedom cannot be granted without limits. In other words, even the state doesn’t unconditionally respect all forms of diversity.</p>\n<p>The same principle applies to organizations. Should a company tolerate an employee who doesn’t keep regular working hours or insists on working from home despite an uncooperative attitude, simply because “we respect diversity”? Diversity deserves respect, but when it conflicts with the organization’s operations and objectives, limits are inevitable.</p>\n<p>Through these observations, I arrived at a conclusion: unconditional respect for diversity is an illusion that cannot exist.</p>\n<p>So is diversity always a bad thing? Of course not. Diversity clearly has both light and shadow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-light-and-shadow-of-diversity\" style=\"position:relative;\">The light and shadow of diversity<a href=\"#the-light-and-shadow-of-diversity\" aria-label=\"the light and shadow of diversity permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>The positive effects of diversity are real. When team members with varied backgrounds come together, new ideas emerge and more approaches to problem-solving open up. Working in a frontend organization of about 100 people, I’ve met an incredible variety of developers and collaborated closely with non-developer colleagues. Through this, I’ve felt the synergy created when talented, diverse people come together.</p>\n<p>But diversity doesn’t always produce positive outcomes. As differences in opinion grow, the time and energy required for coordination increase exponentially, and team cohesion can weaken in the process. As Buddhist dependent origination teaches, because all phenomena are interdependent, a change in one element can have unexpected effects on the entire system.</p>\n<p>Understanding this dual nature of diversity allowed me to look at the team member I mentioned earlier from a new angle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anattā-non-self-and-the-possibility-of-change\" style=\"position:relative;\">Anattā (non-self) and the possibility of change<a href=\"#anatt%C4%81-non-self-and-the-possibility-of-change\" aria-label=\"anattā non self and the possibility of change permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Reflecting more deeply on this team member, I was reminded of the Buddhist concept of anattā — non-self. Individual diversity is not a fixed, unchanging attribute; it shifts constantly. Just because that team member doesn’t want to grow right now doesn’t mean they never will.</p>\n<p>As a leader, I’ve always tried to present higher-level goals to my team members. This wasn’t merely about driving performance — it came from a genuine desire to draw out each person’s potential and help them grow as professionals. But through this process, I reached a conclusion: growth cannot be forced. You can propose growth, but the final decision and responsibility belong to the individual.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I realized that what’s needed is the wisdom to respect someone’s choice in the present moment while keeping the door open for change and waiting patiently.</p>\n<p>But simply waiting isn’t the answer either. As a leader, I also needed concrete principles for how to communicate and act.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wisdom-from-the-noble-eightfold-path-right-communication\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wisdom from the Noble Eightfold Path: right communication<a href=\"#wisdom-from-the-noble-eightfold-path-right-communication\" aria-label=\"wisdom from the noble eightfold path right communication permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>What helped me here was the Buddhist Noble Eightfold Path — the eight practices the Buddha prescribed as the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>Among these, Right Speech and Right Action clearly illustrate the principles a leader should follow when communicating with team members.</p>\n<p>Right Speech means avoiding lies, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle chatter, and instead speaking truthfully and helpfully. Right Action means behaving in ways that don’t harm yourself or others.</p>\n<p>When proposing growth, it’s crucial to use truthful, constructive language rather than criticism or coercion, and to act in ways that benefit both the individual and the organization. The key isn’t pushing some abstract goal of “getting better” — it’s concretely showing what that growth means and what positive impact it can have.</p>\n<p>But when you try to put these principles into practice, you inevitably face another complex problem: how to balance your own values as a leader with your team members’ diverse perspectives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leadership-through-compassion-and-skillful-means\" style=\"position:relative;\">Leadership through compassion and skillful means<a href=\"#leadership-through-compassion-and-skillful-means\" aria-label=\"leadership through compassion and skillful means permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This dilemma resembles the clash of political ideologies. Progressive and conservative — each has its own strengths and weaknesses. It’s not a matter of right versus wrong, but a difference in which direction to pursue. The same goes for organizational culture. Even if I hold certain beliefs and values as a leader, is it justified to impose them on my team? Yet if I allow total freedom in everything, the organization may descend into chaos.</p>\n<p>In Buddhism, compassion (karuṇā) isn’t mere sympathy. It’s genuinely helping others find true well-being. I believe my desire for my team members’ growth is an expression of this same compassion.

Humans almost never interpret A as straightforwardly as that. Every person carries biases shaped by the environment they grew up in and the experiences they’ve accumulated, so even when you say the same thing, each person may react differently.</p>\n<p>Computers are also guaranteed to deliver the same performance under the same conditions. Humans, on the other hand, might deliver 100% performance one day and suddenly drop to 50% for entirely illogical reasons — making their behavior hard to predict.</p>\n<p>People who were recognized for their ability to work with computers — those perfectly logical machines — are suddenly asked to deal with humans, who are anything but logical. It would be stranger if they didn’t find it difficult.</p>\n<p>I, too, have experienced various types of failure — demoralizing team members through poor decisions, or failing to provide psychological support when it was needed — largely because I lacked a fundamental understanding of human nature.</p>\n<p>That’s why I came to believe that a leader needs more than just communication skills. You need a humanities-grounded understanding of yourself, of human psychology and instinct, and of organizational dynamics. To become a good leader, I thought I first needed to deepen my understanding of human nature and the characteristics that emerge when these “human objects” form a group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-a-good-leader\" style=\"position:relative;\">What makes a good leader?<a href=\"#what-makes-a-good-leader\" aria-label=\"what makes a good leader permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>When I first took on the F-Lead role at Toss three years ago, and later the Frontend Chapter Lead role at Quotalab, the first question I asked myself was: “What is a good leader?”</p>\n<p>Since “good” is a subjective value judgment that inevitably differs from person to person, there’s no definitive right answer.

It states that humans are beings who motivate themselves through internal factors like interest and curiosity, actively developing their sense of self toward psychological growth and integration. The theory identifies three key needs, autonomy, competence, and relatedness, that show a strong positive correlation with intrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andragogy</a>, which is often discussed in the context of lifelong learning, understanding what drives adult behavior places particular emphasis on autonomy — the learner’s own will.</p>\n<p>Since autonomy is ultimately a psychological product of feeling that you’re acting by your own choice, I believe that to guide people’s behavior in a particular direction, you first need their empathy toward that direction.</p>\n<p>Empathy, after all, isn’t something that can be force-fed from the outside (short of brainwashing). It’s an emotion that must be self-determined and self-convinced, which makes it the most suitable emotion for triggering intrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>However, if you try to drive people’s behavior through external control factors alone — without any intrinsic motivation in place — their resistance to stress will be low when obstacles arise.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/0ff19/tree2.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"tree2\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/6af66/tree2.png\" srcset=\"/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/69538/tree2.png 160w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/72799/tree2.png 320w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/6af66/tree2.png 640w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/d9199/tree2.png 960w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/21b4d/tree2.png 1280w,\n/static/e5da4b9f591a004456c5e04af9415083/0ff19/tree2.png 2084w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Some argue that leadership through persuasion and empathy doesn't scale with larger teams,<br>\n  but organizations that large typically don't have the leader directly communicating with every member anyway.<br>\n  The leader communicates this way to middle leaders, who in turn do the same with their teams.</small>\n</center>\n<p>This is especially critical in environments like startups, where people often have to endure high workloads and long hours to achieve distant missions. Stress undermines productivity, engagement, and sense of belonging — it’s not something you can dismiss as just an individual’s problem.</p>\n<p>In other words, no matter how passionately a leader talks about their goals, team members without intrinsic motivation won’t simply fall in line and give their all. Even if they go along, their behavior is fundamentally driven by external control factors — the leader’s goals and authority — so expecting that behavior to persist under severe stress is unrealistic.</p>\n<p>External motivation also tends to focus on results rather than the act itself, giving it an instrumental quality. Some research suggests that if controlling stimuli are applied — like saying “You’re doing well following my instructions” — it can undermine autonomy and intrinsic motivation, significantly reducing productivity.</p>\n<p>This is particularly true for people in industries like IT that require creativity rather than mechanical repetition. There’s also the view that extrinsic motivators like monetary incentives are even less effective for such workers. Moreover, continuously providing extrinsic motivation risks damaging intrinsic motivation in the long run, so very careful reward design is needed. <em>(Imagine a company that provides performance-linked bonuses and then suddenly stops. Wouldn’t people start thinking “Why bother if there’s no money in it?“)</em></p>\n<p>That’s why I concluded that to keep team members highly motivated and actively contributing even in stressful environments, you need to build an environment where they feel maximum autonomy, ensuring a strong tendency toward self-actualization among the people in the organization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-people-feel-they-decided-for-themselves\" style=\"position:relative;\">Making people feel they decided for themselves<a href=\"#making-people-feel-they-decided-for-themselves\" aria-label=\"making people feel they decided for themselves permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>From a leader’s perspective, it’s certainly easier to use external control factors (rewarding high performers, punishing underperformers, or leveraging organizational politics) to get people moving.</p>\n<p>But as I mentioned, intrinsic motivation matters a lot in driving adult behavior. Relying solely on external control factors creates an environment ripe for side effects like low morale, gossip, or people checking out entirely.</p>\n<p>Unlike material resources, human resources are entities capable of emotion and thought, making them difficult to predict and control through a mechanistic lens.</p>\n<p>So leaders need to create an environment where intrinsic motivation can emerge. There are many methods: appropriate delegation of decision-making authority, environments where people can taste small wins (technical and business), clear goals and expectations. But among these, I placed the most weight on the value of autonomy.</p>\n<p>The autonomy a team member feels at work comes from things like exercising decision-making authority over their product, a leader who asks for opinions rather than issuing directives, and being given choices and allowed to make their own selections. It’s about the team member feeling — or actually experiencing — that they’re contributing to the organization through their own autonomous agency.</p>\n<p>Since autonomy isn’t a clear-cut sensation like pain but rather a psychological awareness of exercising one’s own agency, even if team members are unknowingly moving in the direction the organization wants, as long as they believe they have autonomy, that autonomy is effectively secured.</p>\n<p>There’s also substantial empirical research — both domestic and international — showing that work autonomy has a significant positive correlation with organizational trust, job satisfaction, engagement, and performance. In other words, the fact that autonomy can trigger intrinsic motivation appears to hold regardless of commonly cited East-West differences in thinking.</p>\n<p>Of course, given the nature of a company, you can’t guarantee 100% autonomy for everyone. But as I mentioned, autonomy is a psychological awareness rather than an objective sensation — so even just showing that the leader supports team members’ autonomy can have an effect. Alternatively, depending on the leader’s skill, it may be possible to help internalize and integrate externally assigned motivations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"actions-leaders-can-take-to-strengthen-team-autonomy\" style=\"position:relative;\">Actions leaders can take to strengthen team autonomy<a href=\"#actions-leaders-can-take-to-strengthen-team-autonomy\" aria-label=\"actions leaders can take to strengthen team autonomy permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>So what specific methods can strengthen team members’ autonomy?</p>\n<p>I believe the first step is to analyze and diagnose the current state of the organization — specifically, what motivates each person. Since autonomy is a precondition for creating intrinsic motivation to boost productivity and engagement, if people already have intrinsic motivation, there’s not much to worry about. <em>(Though in practice, when you actually observe and analyze, surprisingly few people operate on intrinsic motivation.)</em></p>\n<p>You could ask directly in 1-on-1 meetings — “Do you find your current work enjoyable?” or “Why did you become a developer?” — but personally, I prefer analyzing information that comes up in casual conversation.</p>\n<p>The reason is that the moment you ask someone a question, they might develop biased thinking around that question. Combined with the inherent discomfort of meeting with a leader and the collectivist tendency of not wanting to stand out, they may not share their true feelings. Asking questions without biasing the other person is critically important in situations like user research and interviews — and it’s harder than you’d think.</p>\n<p>That’s why I believe the information that emerges in relaxed settings — smoking a cigarette together, chatting at a café, grabbing dinner after work — tends to be more honest and valuable than what comes out in official 1-on-1 meetings.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/88bbaa99baf8428b6ba76c3155bfa436/92f8c/coffeechat.webp\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqAAAABXRUJQVlA4IJQAAADQAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYwCw7BkpyV2/BHFckAAA/pvji9/W2qDheS63N7lYqMRN5bw/LSPvJdYOLlD/IEO4bR7tqTNTS5aW2M9ZvgsCUzkZUItHH3NW15GyKNZA6i2r90hoG+c//yAGLbxjKNebsEjIWGyXkz4QRqq7P7+S2Fqulyh/0AfV8AAA'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"coffeechat\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/88bbaa99baf8428b6ba76c3155bfa436/0ba47/coffeechat.webp\" srcset=\"/static/88bbaa99baf8428b6ba76c3155bfa436/60a22/coffeechat.webp 160w,\n/static/88bbaa99baf8428b6ba76c3155bfa436/4c812/coffeechat.webp 320w,\n/static/88bbaa99baf8428b6ba76c3155bfa436/0ba47/coffeechat.webp 640w,\n/static/88bbaa99baf8428b6ba76c3155bfa436/e46b2/coffeechat.webp 960w,\n/static/88bbaa99baf8428b6ba76c3155bfa436/92f8c/coffeechat.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The more comfortable the environment and the more friendly gestures you show, the more likely people are to be honest with you.</small>\n</center>\n<p>I’d record pieces of information I deemed meaningful, and then categorize people’s motivations using the classification method proposed in an <a href=\"https://scholarworks.bwise.kr/hanyang/handle/2021.sw.hanyang/143183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">academic paper on applying Self-Determination Theory to HRD</a>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Motivation Type</th>\n<th>Behavioral Principle</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Amotivation</td>\n<td>Don’t know why I’m doing this</td>\n<td>I don’t know why I have to do this work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>External Regulation</td>\n<td>To obtain a result</td>\n<td>I do this work to score well on performance reviews</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Introjected Regulation</td>\n<td>Out of obligation</td>\n<td>I do this because I should be a good team member</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identified Regulation</td>\n<td>Because it’s important</td>\n<td>I do this because it’s necessary for the company’s growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integrated Regulation</td>\n<td>Because it represents my values</td>\n<td>I do this because it expresses who I am</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Intrinsic Motivation</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Because the work itself is interesting</strong></td>\n<td><strong>I do this because the work itself is fascinating and fun</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>🤔 One interesting observation: people who were earlier in their careers more often had introjected regulation or intrinsic motivation, while those with more experience more often showed external regulation or identified regulation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps those who chose development because “coding is fun” still carry that initial learning motivation, while more senior developers have accumulated responsibilities beyond personal interest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In any case, the leader’s role as I defined it is to move people operating on extrinsic motivations — external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, integrated regulation — toward operating on intrinsic motivation. Simply put, it means figuring out what makes “an environment where people enjoy working” and striving to create it.</p>\n<p>And the way to internalize motivation is to make team members feel autonomy.

But I believed that preserving team members’ intrinsic motivation mattered more than the speed gained from top-down announcements. That’s why I chose to collect feedback before making decisions. Besides, in a small organization of just 5–6 people like the one I led, the leader actively gathering opinions doesn’t significantly slow things down. <em>(And no matter how talented the leader, it’s hard to beat collective intelligence.)</em></p>\n<p>I also judged that if people are given the chance to participate in decision-making, they’re more likely to empathize with the final decision compared to a simple announcement. Even if their opinion wasn’t adopted, they had the chance to voice it and hear the reasoning behind why it wasn’t — a form of equality of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Of course, depending on the team member’s personality and situation, some may find it hard to voice their opinions. But since the organization provided ample opportunity to speak up, whether or not they actually do so is their own choice, which doesn’t significantly violate their autonomy.</p>\n<p>However, the leader’s response should differ depending on whether someone’s reluctance stems from an internal characteristic like an introverted personality, or from external factors like being new to the company, having recently been criticized, or having been burned by office politics at a previous job.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/b4294/pressure.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"pressure\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/b4294/pressure.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/0913d/pressure.jpg 160w,\n/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/cb69c/pressure.jpg 320w,\n/static/072a9adb700670671eb12dbe4a7c7d4a/b4294/pressure.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This is a common preconception among workers in Korean corporate culture,<br>so don't expect people to speak up enthusiastically just because you ask for opinions.</small>\n</center>\n<p>In the former case, if someone’s personality simply doesn’t incline them toward asserting their views, pushing them to share opinions probably won’t change anything.

If I had a good idea, I’d propose it to the relevant squad’s engineer and delegate the choice to them. Many organizations withhold decision-making authority from juniors or new hires, but I delegated trust and authority regardless of experience level.</p>\n<p>I had two main reasons for this. First, to create intrinsic motivation through autonomy, as discussed above. Second, to ensure that the emotions around success and failure from decision outcomes were felt most strongly by the team member themselves.</p>\n<p>I believe all humans grow through failure, so each individual’s sense and emotional response to failure within the team is extremely important.</p>\n<p>But if a leader gives specific instructions, the emotions around success and failure no longer belong to the team member. The leader held the final decision-making authority, and the team member merely followed orders — so the emotional weight of outcomes tends to be attributed to the decision-maker, the leader. <em>(If the leader also has a self-serving bias (taking credit for successes and blaming others or circumstances for failures), team members’ frustration will only grow. In the worst case, the team implodes.)</em></p>\n<p>When a team member makes their own decision and faces the consequences, the sense of responsibility they feel is far greater than when the leader made the call for them. I believe this is the most fundamental element of what people commonly call the “autonomy and responsibility” principle.</p>\n<p>However, if you design this environment and then blame team members for their failures, that’s a shortcut to disaster. This kind of environment must be accompanied by a value like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone can fail. It’s okay to fail.</p>\n<p>But if you do fail, make sure you extract the lessons learned and share them so your colleagues don’t repeat the same mistakes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>New hires and junior members especially tend to fear failure, so the leader absolutely needs to say this explicitly. You could also intentionally show small failures of your own as the leader, though this approach can backfire and erode trust if you haven’t built enough rapport yet — so read the room.</p>\n<p>These kinds of practices aren’t common in typical Korean companies, so some team members may be experiencing them for the first time. In such cases, side effects can occur — people being afraid of being the decision-maker, or beating themselves up for not expressing their thoughts well — requiring appropriate responses from the leader.</p>\n<p>From the leader’s perspective, when you delegate final decision-making authority, you’re still on the hook if things go wrong. Delegating authority doesn’t free you from responsibility for the team’s failures. In other words, by delegating final decision-making to team members, you deliberately create a situation where you have responsibility without authority. <del>(You have to dig your own grave.)</del></p>\n<p>Some leaders might feel anxious about losing control when they delegate decision-making authority. But if you’ve built sufficient rapport or present solid logical reasoning, most team members will seriously consider the leader’s proposals before making their decision — and in the end, things often go the way the leader suggested anyway.</p>\n<p>What matters, then, is the leader’s persuasive ability and the trust they’ve built with team members. If a team member doesn’t follow my suggestion, I think it’s healthier to reflect on whether I failed to persuade them, rather than to blame them.</p>\n<p>Over a year and a half, I delegated final decision-making authority to various frontend engineers. Regardless of experience level, anyone who passed the three-month probation could participate as an interviewer, among other policies. Apart from occasional cases where someone was nervous about having decision-making responsibility, it was rarely a problem. In most cases, through chapter-wide discussions or suggestions from me or other colleagues, people made good decisions.</p>\n<p>For interview process participation in particular, there were reactions like “Am I really qualified to evaluate someone?” But starting with résumé screening, they quickly adapted — and some even ended up proposing improvements to fill gaps in the interview process.</p>\n<p>If anything, this decision-making structure enabled the frontend chapter to make decisions quickly, which translated to increased overall performance.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/019a6/commits.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 27.500000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAyUlEQVR42p2QzY7CMAyE8z6U5o/SNkmTLELaQuHGEd7/MYZJumIlJC4cPo09cWzLYqNHfI16jx2E3Ee0u/Ad+wDZUy11KPEEoUpDGz7z3sSsutUBKnuoE5k99NXX5kJ2Eyd5tP06sVLint7wl3e+si2bRH6+OMjkYW4O9kHuK3rx3HBIMD8J+hChU4Q9ZJgjYW6OqXomZtiUoQNrf1mzTLBzwm6hf06ENXNEd80Qjfk/bFNx9cCNcq+jv3zWNpLaru81lmPNixbvCdRBw12y6juTAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"commits\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/6af66/commits.png\" srcset=\"/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/69538/commits.png 160w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/72799/commits.png 320w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/6af66/commits.png 640w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/d9199/commits.png 960w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/21b4d/commits.png 1280w,\n/static/56eb2f16b822e0987728e86234b6bad5/019a6/commits.png 1818w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>You can roughly gauge performance by looking at the trend of commits merged to main.<br>I joined in March 2022, and the frontend chapter only grew by three people over that period.</small>\n</center>\n<p>While some expressed concern about this system, the reality is that I only delegated final decision-making — I didn’t tell anyone to be a dictator. Any team member’s decision-making process was naturally accompanied by suggestions and feedback from other team members. The pressure of being responsible for their own decisions also compelled them to strive for the most rational choices possible.</p>\n<p>This feedback came in various forms — code reviews, Slack discussions, or offline conversations — and the decision-maker would hear diverse opinions from colleagues before making the final call. Most problems get caught through this process.</p>\n<p>There may be small failures early on when you first delegate, but as I discussed, since the failure resulted from their own choice, they’ll naturally work to avoid repeating the same mistakes. The motivation for this effort might be extrinsic — not wanting to lose colleagues’ trust, or self-satisfaction — but humans inherently possess a need for competence, a desire to be recognized by others. Nobody wants to look incompetent, so they inevitably make the effort.</p>\n<p>Of course, if someone keeps repeating the same failures, you need to provide appropriate feedback while being careful not to let them lose too much sense of competence through self-deprecation like “I’m hopeless at everything.” Just be honest — acknowledge what they’re doing well and suggest working together on areas that need improvement. <em>(I found myself saying this kind of thing a lot when helping colleagues strategize for passing their probation period.)</em></p>\n<p>By delegating decision-making authority to the engineer who knows their squad’s situation best and supporting them, you remove the funnel of reporting to and getting approval from someone — increasing decision speed. You accelerate growth by letting team members directly experience the emotions of failure. And in the long run, you strengthen team members’ autonomy and competence.</p>\n<p>However, this kind of decision-making structure carries a high risk of devolving into everyone-does-their-own-thing chaos, so clear goal alignment across the entire team is absolutely essential.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-discuss-the-chapters-reason-for-existence-and-mission-together\" style=\"position:relative;\">Always discuss the chapter’s reason for existence and mission together<a href=\"#always-discuss-the-chapters-reason-for-existence-and-mission-together\" aria-label=\"always discuss the chapters reason for existence and mission together permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The third value I upheld was always discussing the frontend chapter’s reason for existence and mission together as a team. An organization, by definition, is a group formed to achieve goals that can’t be accomplished alone — its very raison d’être comes from its mission.</p>\n<p>If people have no say in something this important, it’s only natural for their sense of belonging to decline. So when defining the frontend chapter’s purpose, I made every effort to incorporate as many team members’ opinions as possible.</p>\n<p>These missions were typically defined in OKR format, and I made sure discussions focused more on the Objective — the essence of the mission — than on Key Results, which are merely indicators of whether the mission has been achieved.</p>\n<p>A clear goal like “we are a team organized to achieve X, our mission is Y, and our strategy to achieve it is Z” is essentially a belief about why the frontend chapter can meaningfully exist within the company.</p>\n<p>If this belief wavers, sentiment like “I don’t even know why the frontend chapter exists” can form both inside and outside the chapter. This leads to declining morale and sense of belonging, which in turn erodes competence and intrinsic motivation.</p>\n<p>Another reason organizational mission matters so much is that running an organization isn’t like StarCraft, where you just hotkey your units and attack-move. It’s more like Overwatch or PUBG — games where diverse humans with individual decision-making abilities come together to fight toward a shared objective.</p>\n<p>StarCraft units don’t question orders. They faithfully execute whatever command is given, even if you send naked Marines without Medics into a field of Lurkers for certain annihilation. That’s why a single player can comfortably control dozens of units with 100% compliance.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/e811e/starcraft.webp\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnQAAABXRUJQVlA4IGgAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAKZMiOSZ6N48AAP6D8LCXxye6Sw9VzNZuMt908H/TIL5d9rtu/M2Jh7bGriXafJbW3eH9HIkK85FXn/wNpS2QjFIPbwt1UH2+10oAAA=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"starcraft\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/0ba47/starcraft.webp\" srcset=\"/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/60a22/starcraft.webp 160w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/4c812/starcraft.webp 320w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/0ba47/starcraft.webp 640w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/e46b2/starcraft.webp 960w,\n/static/f65bcc2a376d4096f7dd96c85e80a523/e811e/starcraft.webp 1060w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>If you mistake organizational management for StarCraft, team pushback is inevitable.</small>\n</center>\n<p>But in games like Overwatch or PUBG, calling out orders is critical. These are games where multiple humans form a team to achieve objectives together.</p>\n<p>When you’re supposed to push the payload together but one teammate keeps charging into enemy lines for kills and dying, while another is left guarding the payload alone and getting overwhelmed — the game grinds to a halt. The leader needs to call out clearly: “Everyone focus on pushing the payload,” “The rest of you draw aggro from the payload while Genji takes out Widowmaker.” <em>(Unless the team is deep in the lower ranks, this shouldn’t happen too often… I think.)</em></p>\n<p>Real organizational management works similarly. Games at least provide a clear built-in objective, so there’s no need to think about goals. Real organizations have to align on goals first. Without this process, you end up with a team in name only — where one person is playing Overwatch and another is playing PUBG.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/e1596/star.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"star\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/c08c5/star.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/0913d/star.jpg 160w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/cb69c/star.jpg 320w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/c08c5/star.jpg 640w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/6a068/star.jpg 960w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/eea4a/star.jpg 1280w,\n/static/ddd1754f6428521be9f2d73642b9e0b1/e1596/star.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>An organization's goal is the coordinates of a star everyone navigates toward.<br>If everyone doesn't have the same star's coordinates in their heads, the voyage will struggle.</small>\n</center>\n<p>That’s why I made sure that important values like the frontend chapter’s purpose and mission were always defined through everyone’s participation, input, and discussion.

But naturally, goals you set yourself stick in your mind longer than goals imposed by someone else.</p>\n<p>I let the frontend chapter determine its own direction.

I believe that a leader and team members aren’t in a hierarchical relationship — they simply have different roles. And to perform well in each of those roles, you inevitably need help from your colleagues.</p>\n<p>A mutual feedback environment also enhances team members’ autonomy by giving them the power to influence the leader’s direction. Of course, simply exchanging feedback isn’t enough — the leader needs to express gratitude after receiving feedback and demonstrate genuine receptiveness. <em>(And if you disagree with the feedback, just explain your reasoning in detail.)</em></p>\n<p>No human is perfect. Even the most talented person has both strengths and weaknesses, and no matter how long someone has worked, they’re inevitably a beginner in areas outside their expertise.</p>\n<p>I have clear strengths, but I also have clear weaknesses. My knowledge in areas outside frontend development — the field I’ve spent years in — is relatively limited, and I can’t claim to be an expert in everything.</p>\n<p>I imagine the same is true for most people. A single, small human can’t possibly be good at everything in this world.</p>\n<p>In very small startups with around ten employees, a talented leader might handle many things simultaneously like a firefighter. But as organizations grow, that becomes increasingly difficult, and failing to delegate properly can produce various side effects.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in such leader-dependent structures, if the leader isn’t exceptionally capable, the entire organization’s performance crumbles along with them. Active mutual feedback can serve as a means to grow the leader when they’re falling short, or to hedge against the leader’s insufficient decision-making ability.</p>\n<p>However, in traditional companies where leaders are often equated with bosses, it’s hard to establish a robust feedback culture unless the leader genuinely possesses the capacity to accept feedback and the ability to separate feedback from their emotions.</p>\n<p>Feedback receptiveness connects to metacognition. Since metacognition is the high-level concept of “knowing what you don’t know,” it’s not easy to cultivate on your own. Most people find themselves in a state where they don’t even know what they don’t know, yet think “I know a lot” — a kind of Sophist thinking.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, I believe the best way to develop metacognitive ability is through team members’ feedback. In practice, as I worked in a leadership role and talked with many people, I often found significant gaps between how I saw myself and how others saw me.</p>\n<p>Here’s my own example. The left column is my self-assessment; the right is feedback from colleagues:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>My Assessment</th>\n<th>Others’ Assessment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Not very emotionally volatile</td>\n<td>I can make decisions without emotional interference</td>\n<td>Your tone is too cold. We’d like to see more inclusion, not exclusion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I tend to share opinions first</td>\n<td>I express my thoughts clearly</td>\n<td>Your expression is so strong that it’s hard to voice opposing views</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I don’t show personal emotions at work</td>\n<td>I clearly separate work and personal life</td>\n<td>You seem unapproachable and lacking warmth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These value judgments inherently include a kind of self-serving bias, so one tends to judge oneself leniently and others strictly. Personal rapport can introduce bias as well. I’m just another human who can’t escape these biases — which is why my self-assessment was skewed positively.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, one thing matters: a leader is in a position where they need to earn others’ trust. So rather than how you see yourself, what matters more is how others perceive your characteristics — and you need to know that clearly and respond accordingly.</p>\n<p>My point isn’t “don’t fall into bias.” While I’m no psychology expert, I believe it’s nearly impossible to completely eliminate these biases.</p>\n<p>What matters is the leader recognizing: “I have biases and errors,” “I’m not that perfect.”</p>\n<p>A leader is human, so naturally there will be areas of strength and areas of weakness. But if you’re not clearly aware of your strengths and weaknesses and try to micromanage beyond your competence or grab excessive decision-making authority, the result can be worse for the organization overall — and it can create problems in earning team members’ trust.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/7bf67/control.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 68.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"control\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/c08c5/control.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/0913d/control.jpg 160w,\n/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/cb69c/control.jpg 320w,\n/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/c08c5/control.jpg 640w,\n/static/3ab89b5cf9446157970eacacf05d02a3/7bf67/control.jpg 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Humans tend to think in ways biased by their experiences,<br>\n  so if your early career was spent in a control-heavy organization, your leadership may unconsciously lean toward control as well. This is why metacognition matters.</small>\n</center>\n<p>A leader isn’t someone who controls team members. They’re someone complementary to them. After all, the role of leader can only exist because team members exist.</p>\n<p>So you need to learn how others perceive you through their feedback, and by taking appropriate action items, shape how you appear to your team in the right direction.</p>\n<p>But stepping out of the ideal and into reality, you’ll find that in most organizations where feedback culture hasn’t taken root, people are afraid to transparently share their thoughts about others. Especially in Eastern cultures that value the group over the individual, a “leader” is often equated with a “commander” — so breaking this preconception is important.</p>\n<p>That’s why leaders need to actively communicate that they want feedback, and deliberately — even exaggeratedly — demonstrate a receptive attitude.</p>\n<p>I held coffee chats with everyone in the frontend chapter every two weeks, and at the end of each session, I always asked for feedback. I consistently made explicit statements like: “Giving me feedback helps me grow,” “I’m not perfect either, and I want to improve my weaknesses through feedback,” “Just as you want to grow, I’m just another developer who wants to grow too.” My goal was to make team members think, “This person is genuinely obsessed with feedback…”</p>\n<p>Of course, extracting meaningful feedback every two weeks isn’t easy — most sessions were a parade of “Nothing in particular.” But by persistently maintaining this practice, I was able to receive meaningful feedback from time to time. <em>(Like being told to come in earlier in the morning…)</em></p>\n<p>When I received feedback I resonated with, I’d establish action items to address it and always share the results afterward. Many things didn’t actually improve, but it was a way of actively signaling that I didn’t ignore their feedback.</p>\n<p>It varies somewhat by personality, but in an authority-oriented culture like Korea’s, giving feedback to a leader takes considerable courage. So naturally, the person receiving feedback should express gratitude for the courage it took, and demonstrate that every word was taken to heart.</p>\n<p>Even if you didn’t agree with the feedback, always express gratitude first for the courage it took, and then explain why you didn’t fully resonate with it.</p>\n<p>Be careful, though: reacting emotionally to feedback, or saying “thank you” but then showing no action items or sharing no follow-through. These patterns will cause team members to develop the mindset “Talking to this person won’t change anything,” and they’ll eventually stop speaking up.</p>\n<p>If more and more colleagues start feeling this way, the organization can become like a boiling pressure cooker, ready to blow at any moment. Frustration with the leader has already built up, but people either fear speaking up or feel powerless that nothing will change even if they do.</p>\n<p>That’s why a leader should consistently and proactively seek feedback from colleagues — continuously gathering information that helps develop metacognition: how colleagues perceive you, where you’re falling short, and what you’re doing well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\">Closing thoughts<a href=\"#closing-thoughts\" aria-label=\"closing thoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After about three years of leadership experience and reflection, the dominant feeling I’ve had is probably “…this is really hard.”</p>\n<p>Computers are friendly companions.

So I needed a lot of reflection and research on topics like “what makes good leadership” and “what drives people.”</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/2a614/estj.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 52.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"estj\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/6af66/estj.png\" srcset=\"/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/69538/estj.png 160w,\n/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/72799/estj.png 320w,\n/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/6af66/estj.png 640w,\n/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/d9199/estj.png 960w,\n/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/21b4d/estj.png 1280w,\n/static/dfc9d10866e65a8c46faf88ef1edd58a/2a614/estj.png 5000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>For the record, my MBTI is a strong ESTJ. I don't love admitting it, but it's surprisingly accurate.</small>\n</center>\n<p>I’m actually someone who’s good at analyzing relationships and connecting them through logical reasoning. So the approach that worked best for me was building knowledge from academic research on human psychology and behavioral principles, then observing and analyzing the people around me to test those theories against reality.</p>\n<p>Of course, no theory explains reality perfectly — especially human behavior, which remains a largely unsolved domain with no definitive answers. All I can do is observe the various situations happening around me, ask myself “why is that person behaving that way?”, and conduct my own analysis.</p>\n<p>Perhaps that’s exactly why I found it so difficult. There aren’t many problems in the world with predetermined right answers, but analyzing and defining something as illogical as humans seems truly, genuinely hard.</p>\n<p>I’m still a fledgling leader with only three years under my belt, so these reflections are just the beginning. There are plenty of days ahead for this kind of thinking, and I’m in no rush.</p>\n<p>This concludes my post: What Do People Work For? — The Psychology of Motivation.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20231003-how-to-be-a-better-leader-en","path":"/2023/10/03/how-to-be-a-better-leader/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Do People Work For? – The Psychology of Motivation","subTitle":"A leader's job isn't to lead: it's to make people move","date":"Oct 30, 2023","categories":["Essay"],"tags":["Leadership","Psychology","Self-Determination Theory"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/3a812/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/3a812/thumbnail.jpg 320w,\n/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/bcf78/thumbnail.jpg 580w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/fc5c5/thumbnail.webp 320w,\n/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/7902e/thumbnail.webp 580w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/f400e/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/f400e/thumbnail.jpg 580w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/81500200d7fd984809aeaa84eeee10f4/2b479/thumbnail.webp 580w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Leadership","lang":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3523904809","650499039"],"slicesMap":{}}
