As everyone knows, a company is fundamentally a profit-seeking organization, so the salary they pay you is an investment. If a company pays you $50,000 a year, they naturally expect you to generate at least that much — or more — in value.</p>\n<p>In other words, a developer isn’t just someone who needs to be good at programming.

The only difference is that what we produce has shifted from physical goods to software. And a craftsperson isn’t just responsible for product quality — they must simultaneously care about real user satisfaction, the company’s business requirements, and much more.</p>\n<p>In other words, a profit-seeking organization doesn’t just need someone who’s good at programming. It needs someone who can use programming to satisfy users and generate the revenue that follows.</p>\n<p>That’s why many organizations look for more than just programming skills when hiring good craftspeople. They also look for smooth collaboration with stakeholders, leadership, business insight, understanding of user experience, and various other skills needed for effective product development.</p>\n<p>Moreover, things like collaboration skills and UX understanding may not generate immediate revenue, but in the long run they significantly impact the company’s brand and culture, and can ultimately transform how the organization works and performs. Serious organizations don’t neglect these factors.</p>\n<p>In short, a developer isn’t just someone who programs — they’re one of many team members racing to make their organization’s product succeed in the market. That’s why developers shouldn’t focus solely on programming, but should develop a broad perspective that encompasses the organization’s business challenges as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-do-developers-pursue-good-design\" style=\"position:relative;\">Why Do Developers Pursue Good Design?<a href=\"#why-do-developers-pursue-good-design\" aria-label=\"why do developers pursue good design permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>When you work as a developer, you can’t help wanting to invest the time for good architecture — it’s your baby, after all.</p>\n<p>Developers know from experience that cutting corners on design today creates debt that boomerangs back eventually. The classic example is the “legacy code” meme that’s ubiquitous among developers.</p>\n<p>Code with poor readability and unclear control flow harbors countless potential bugs. Sometimes bugs occur but slip past tracking tools due to weird exception handling. Poorly designed code can create major pain points for users, and in severe cases, ruin critical user moments and drive them away.</p>\n<p>What’s worse, if you keep piling features on top of bad design without improving it, the bad design only grows. Development isn’t about wiping the slate clean for every new feature — it’s about building on top of what already exists.</p>\n<p>Once design goes off the rails, even a small change can trigger bugs in unexpected places. Developers become increasingly cautious, and the organization’s development velocity gradually slows. Eventually, you might want to add a new feature but literally can’t because the architecture won’t allow it.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 327px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cafdf/no.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 156.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"no\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cafdf/no.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/0913d/no.jpg 160w,\n/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cb69c/no.jpg 320w,\n/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cafdf/no.jpg 327w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>How I feel looking at code I wrote a year ago...</small>\n</center>\n<p>Ultimately, developers pursue good design to maintain high code quality, preserve development velocity, and prevent unpredictable bugs.

But the old man quotes a steep price…</em></p>\n<p><strong>Customer:</strong> “Could you give me a discount?”</p>\n<p><strong>Old man:</strong> “Haggling over one bat? Just go buy one somewhere else.”</p>\n<p><strong>Customer:</strong> “Fine, I’ll pay full price. Just make sure it’s well made.”</p>\n<p><em>The customer watches the old man work, growing increasingly impatient. It looks done to him, but the old man keeps whittling. Time is running out…</em></p>\n<p><strong>Customer:</strong> “It looks finished. Can I just have it?”</p>\n<p><strong>Old man:</strong> “Rice has to boil until it’s done. Raw rice doesn’t become cooked just because you rush it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Customer:</strong> “The buyer says it’s fine!

The old man doesn’t care about customers at all — no wonder his business is struggling.</em></p>\n<p><em>…But later, upon closer inspection, the quality of the bat turns out to be extraordinary.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The story ends with the protagonist wanting to go back and apologize to the old man for failing to appreciate his deeper purpose.</p>\n<p>The moral, in a word, is “respect for craftsmanship,” and it’s frequently cited as an example of the mindset makers should have.</p>\n<p>The old man in the story takes immense pride in his whittling skills. He’s probably been doing this for a long time, which means he has clear convictions about his craft. Developers who’ve been in the industry for a long time aren’t much different in that regard.</p>\n<p>But there’s one crucial difference between this heartwarming story and reality. The old man never intended to sell to anyone who didn’t share his values. That’s essentially the same as a developer telling users, “I need to take my time and build a proper architecture, so if you don’t like it, use a different app” — while users are complaining, “Why is this app so slow to update?”</p>\n<p>Viewed this way, the old man doesn’t seem so professional after all. Wouldn’t a true professional find a way to deliver the best possible quality within the timeframe the customer needs — satisfying both the customer and themselves?</p>\n<p>The protagonist in the story watches the old man work and thinks, “It looks done — why does he keep going?” If the old man represents the developer, then the protagonist represents the users.</p>\n<p>And unlike this patient protagonist, real users won’t wait around the moment they think “something’s off.” They won’t marvel at the quality of your carefully designed product either. The moment users sense something is wrong, they’ll abandon your product and switch to another.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-balance-between-business-and-good-design\" style=\"position:relative;\">Finding the Balance Between Business and Good Design<a href=\"#finding-the-balance-between-business-and-good-design\" aria-label=\"finding the balance between business and good design permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As I’ve discussed, developers need to consider business factors while simultaneously thinking about good application architecture.

If the time you invest in design is more likely to <em>not</em> pay off in the future, then it might be better to just rough it out and ship the feature fast. Business is always about Cost vs. Benefit.</p>\n<p>You might wonder what costs are involved in just “thinking about design,” but they’re real. Your salaries, server costs, office rent — money flows out of the company’s bank account every single day, even when nothing is happening.</p>\n<p>Labor costs in particular are something many people overlook, and they add up surprisingly fast.

That’s the risk a company takes when developing a product. Plus, if you’re running an A/B test, the feature you’re building right now might be deleted within a week.</p>\n<p>In situations like these, always spending time on design isn’t necessarily the right answer.

But if there’s a pressing business issue — like an imminent funding round that requires finding market fit fast and painting a pretty revenue graph — then negotiating for more design time isn’t such a great call.</p>\n<p>No matter how thoughtfully a developer designs for the future, if the company runs out of money and shuts down next month, that code disappears anyway.

Users are unpredictable creatures who might suddenly bounce just because a single line of copy changed on a page. But you can’t just build random things and ship them either — the financial risks of labor costs, server costs, and more are too high.</p>\n<p>That’s why many organizations use A/B testing to reduce this risk. No matter how brilliant the people gathered in a room, no matter how long they discuss and deliberate, at the end of the day it’s all just predicting “our users will behave this way.”</p>\n<p>In other words, until you deploy and actually observe how users interact with your product, every opinion is just speculation — which is why you run these tests.</p>\n<p>If the Control (existing version) shows higher conversion after the test, you simply discard the new Variant. If the Variant wins, you discard the Control. Either way, you safely improve conversion rates with minimal risk, regardless of whether your hypothesis was right.</p>\n<p>For effective data analysis, you also need to control variables as much as possible. If you change a bunch of things at once and the metrics improve, but you can’t tell which specific change drove the user behavior, the test becomes meaningless.</p>\n<p>That’s why A/B tests usually keep most features identical and only make small, focused changes to the part being tested. This means that when coding for an A/B test, there will inevitably be a lot of shared logic between Control and Variant.</p>\n<p>Some developers abstract these common parts for an efficient design. But here’s the trap:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the two will eventually <strong>have to be deleted</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you aggressively abstract shared code or split things into separate modules to reduce duplication, you actually increase the number of things to worry about when it’s time to remove the test code — and mistakes during removal can introduce unexpected bugs.</p>\n<p>Moreover, A/B tests often have nearly identical variations down to trivial details. No matter how carefully you abstract, once the test ends and you delete one side, you may be left with pointless abstractions.</p>\n<p>That’s why A/B test code should be built to be as easy to delete as possible. The code you write for a test isn’t something you’ll maintain long-term — it’s something that gets deleted after a week-long test at most.</p>\n<p>You might say “just revert the commit since we have Git,” but that only works when the Control wins. If the new Variant wins, a revert is useless.</p>\n<p>In cases like this, forget abstraction — just copy the entire page, route to <code class=\"language-text\">/test-page/a</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">/test-page/b</code> based on the A/B test variable, and when results come in, cleanly delete the losing page. That might actually be the better design.</p>\n<p>If you develop with a narrow, programming-only perspective without considering these business realities, you might end up doing perfectly solid design work only to receive “overengineering” feedback — which is a truly sad outcome.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>In this post, I’ve talked about the relationship between business and application design. Honestly, more experienced developers probably already know all of this.</p>\n<p>But for developers who are just starting out, it’s common for their overflowing enthusiasm to be channeled entirely into programming-related work — refactoring architecture, adopting new and efficient technologies. When I first started as a developer, I was the same way. I said we needed to refactor all the legacy code without considering any business context, and received feedback to broaden my perspective. <del>(Embarrassingly, at the time I thought the person giving that feedback was just being stubborn…)</del></p>\n<p>Of course, as a developer myself, I get excited about open-for-extension architectures, clearly separated modules, and side-effect-free functions.

It’s actually a question I’ve been carrying since I first started coding.

After about five years of working as a frontend developer across various organizations, I’d received all sorts of feedback from colleagues. Some generous souls would say things like “Evan is really good at frontend,” and I could never bring myself to confidently reply “Why yes, I am.”</p>\n<p>The reason is simply that I don’t think I’m good at frontend development. And I don’t trust the subjective assessments others assign to me. What I’ve always wanted — and still want — is to be a “good developer” with objective, universally acknowledged value.</p>\n<p>People’s standards differ, of course, but I think “being good” by objective standards means having mastered a body of knowledge. And if you ask whether I’ve mastered frontend development, the answer is obviously “no.” There’s still so much I don’t know, and I spend every day fumbling through new problems and praying to the Google gods.</p>\n<p>So for six years, I’ve been wrestling with: “What is true knowledge?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-was-a-good-developer\" style=\"position:relative;\">I “Was” a Good Developer<a href=\"#i-was-a-good-developer\" aria-label=\"i was a good developer permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I didn’t always have this existential crisis.

Here’s the question I want to pose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are frontend developers and markup engineers the same position?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For context: in the Korean tech industry, “publisher” (퍼블리셔) is a common title for specialists who primarily handle HTML/CSS markup. This distinction between “frontend developer” and “markup engineer” exists in many tech ecosystems under different names — “HTML/CSS developer,” “UI developer,” “web designer who codes,” etc.</p>\n<p>If you work in this industry, you probably have opinions about these roles and how they differ. Let me push the question further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can you distinguish between these two positions?\nIf so, what criteria do you use?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I’m really asking is: what’s the clear, definitive line between the two?</p>\n<p>Both positions build web clients. Yet people draw fairly rigid distinctions between them. So presumably, they know how to tell them apart.</p>\n<p>Generally, a frontend developer is someone who writes client programs that run in web browsers — defining DOM structures with HTML, exchanging data with backend systems using JavaScript, building standalone client applications, and sometimes crafting elegant UI/UX with CSS.</p>\n<p>But laid out like that, it sounds a lot like what a markup engineer does too. In fact, when you look at actual day-to-day work, they’re often identical.</p>\n<p>Some say markup engineers aren’t frontend developers because they don’t know React or Vue. But then what about the people who used to build complex web clients with jQuery? Were they markup engineers? Yet the industry clearly recognized the title “frontend developer” at that time — I was called one myself.</p>\n<p>Others say markup engineers lack the JavaScript or computer science knowledge that frontend developers have. Okay, then let me ask this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much JavaScript does a markup engineer need to know to be called a frontend developer?\nDoes simply acquiring CS knowledge instantly make someone a frontend developer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where answers diverge. Some might say you need to understand closures. Others might say closures don’t matter, but you should be able to resolve CORS policy violations on your own.</p>\n<p>Let’s say knowing closures fluently makes you a frontend developer. But is a rough understanding of the concept enough? Or do you need to know how function scopes and closures are created within the JavaScript engine? It’s ambiguous.</p>\n<p>What criteria were <em>you</em> using to separate these two positions? Were you actually clear on those criteria? Or was the distinction meaningless from the start?</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-socrates-not-a-sophist\" style=\"position:relative;\">Be Socrates, Not a Sophist<a href=\"#be-socrates-not-a-sophist\" aria-label=\"be socrates not a sophist permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>If you couldn’t properly answer those questions, then you don’t truly know the difference between the two roles.

So he taught for free, which naturally made him unpopular with the other Sophists.</p>\n<p>Then one day, Socrates received an oracle from the Temple of Delphi that would spark his lifelong quest into the nature of knowledge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-know-that-i-know-nothing\" style=\"position:relative;\">I Know That I Know Nothing<a href=\"#i-know-that-i-know-nothing\" aria-label=\"i know that i know nothing permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The oracle declared that Socrates was the wisest person in Athens. In an era still governed by mythological thinking, oracles carried the weight of law. But Socrates refused to believe it and resolved to find someone wiser than himself.</p>\n<p>From then on, Socrates went around questioning the Sophists — the highly-paid intellectual elite — to gauge how wise they truly were. If we map Socrates’ line of questioning onto our earlier topic, it would go something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What is a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: Someone who has the knowledge needed to build web clients and can actually implement them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then isn’t a markup engineer also a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: No.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What’s the difference between the two?\n<strong>A</strong>: I’d say markup engineers have less computer science knowledge than frontend developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So if a markup engineer studies computer science, do they become a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: I think they’d also need to get hired as a frontend developer to truly be called one.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So the position assigned by a company matters?\n<strong>A</strong>: …I suppose so.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then if a frontend developer at a prestigious tech company takes a markup engineer position at a web agency, are they a frontend developer or a markup engineer?\n<strong>A</strong>: … (contradiction)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was Socrates’ method. He’d ask fundamental questions, and when someone answered, he’d probe the inconsistencies in their response with follow-up questions. After a few rounds, the Sophists would hit a wall — realizing that what they “knew” was actually flawed. They’d become flustered or angry.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 59.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ship\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/0913d/ship.jpg 160w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/cb69c/ship.jpg 320w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg 640w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This state of being shipwrecked on contradictions and impasses is called \"aporia\"</small>\n</center>\n<p>After visiting Sophist after Sophist and finding that none could fully withstand his questioning, Socrates concluded: “These people don’t truly know anything.”</p>\n<p>What about you?

After repeating this process over and over, he arrived at a single realization:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only thing I know is that I know nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a statement directed at himself as much as at the Sophists. Neither you nor I truly know anything — but at least I know that I don’t know.</p>\n<p>And Socrates’ conclusion isn’t wrong, either.

He was eventually charged with “corrupting the youth and undermining Athenian traditions.”</p>\n<p>He could have survived the trial by playing politics and talking his way out, but Socrates refused to bend his convictions.
