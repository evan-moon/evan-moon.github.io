It’s actually a question I’ve been carrying since I first started coding.

After about five years of working as a frontend developer across various organizations, I’d received all sorts of feedback from colleagues. Some generous souls would say things like “Evan is really good at frontend,” and I could never bring myself to confidently reply “Why yes, I am.”</p>\n<p>The reason is simply that I don’t think I’m good at frontend development. And I don’t trust the subjective assessments others assign to me. What I’ve always wanted — and still want — is to be a “good developer” with objective, universally acknowledged value.</p>\n<p>People’s standards differ, of course, but I think “being good” by objective standards means having mastered a body of knowledge. And if you ask whether I’ve mastered frontend development, the answer is obviously “no.” There’s still so much I don’t know, and I spend every day fumbling through new problems and praying to the Google gods.</p>\n<p>So for six years, I’ve been wrestling with: “What is true knowledge?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-was-a-good-developer\" style=\"position:relative;\">I “Was” a Good Developer<a href=\"#i-was-a-good-developer\" aria-label=\"i was a good developer permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I didn’t always have this existential crisis.

Here’s the question I want to pose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are frontend developers and markup engineers the same position?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For context: in the Korean tech industry, “publisher” (퍼블리셔) is a common title for specialists who primarily handle HTML/CSS markup. This distinction between “frontend developer” and “markup engineer” exists in many tech ecosystems under different names — “HTML/CSS developer,” “UI developer,” “web designer who codes,” etc.</p>\n<p>If you work in this industry, you probably have opinions about these roles and how they differ. Let me push the question further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can you distinguish between these two positions?\nIf so, what criteria do you use?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I’m really asking is: what’s the clear, definitive line between the two?</p>\n<p>Both positions build web clients. Yet people draw fairly rigid distinctions between them. So presumably, they know how to tell them apart.</p>\n<p>Generally, a frontend developer is someone who writes client programs that run in web browsers — defining DOM structures with HTML, exchanging data with backend systems using JavaScript, building standalone client applications, and sometimes crafting elegant UI/UX with CSS.</p>\n<p>But laid out like that, it sounds a lot like what a markup engineer does too. In fact, when you look at actual day-to-day work, they’re often identical.</p>\n<p>Some say markup engineers aren’t frontend developers because they don’t know React or Vue. But then what about the people who used to build complex web clients with jQuery? Were they markup engineers? Yet the industry clearly recognized the title “frontend developer” at that time — I was called one myself.</p>\n<p>Others say markup engineers lack the JavaScript or computer science knowledge that frontend developers have. Okay, then let me ask this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much JavaScript does a markup engineer need to know to be called a frontend developer?\nDoes simply acquiring CS knowledge instantly make someone a frontend developer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where answers diverge. Some might say you need to understand closures.

In an era still governed by mythological thinking, oracles carried the weight of law. But Socrates refused to believe it and resolved to find someone wiser than himself.</p>\n<p>From then on, Socrates went around questioning the Sophists — the highly-paid intellectual elite — to gauge how wise they truly were. If we map Socrates’ line of questioning onto our earlier topic, it would go something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What is a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: Someone who has the knowledge needed to build web clients and can actually implement them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then isn’t a markup engineer also a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: No.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What’s the difference between the two?\n<strong>A</strong>: I’d say markup engineers have less computer science knowledge than frontend developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So if a markup engineer studies computer science, do they become a frontend developer?\n<strong>A</strong>: I think they’d also need to get hired as a frontend developer to truly be called one.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: So the position assigned by a company matters?\n<strong>A</strong>: …I suppose so.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then if a frontend developer at a prestigious tech company takes a markup engineer position at a web agency, are they a frontend developer or a markup engineer?\n<strong>A</strong>: … (contradiction)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was Socrates’ method. He’d ask fundamental questions, and when someone answered, he’d probe the inconsistencies in their response with follow-up questions. After a few rounds, the Sophists would hit a wall — realizing that what they “knew” was actually flawed. They’d become flustered or angry.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 59.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ship\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/0913d/ship.jpg 160w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/cb69c/ship.jpg 320w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/c08c5/ship.jpg 640w,\n/static/433945b00cf1edc742e9ea4a65d6c16d/29d31/ship.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>This state of being shipwrecked on contradictions and impasses is called \"aporia\"</small>\n</center>\n<p>After visiting Sophist after Sophist and finding that none could fully withstand his questioning, Socrates concluded: “These people don’t truly know anything.”</p>\n<p>What about you?

But if Socrates came at me with questions like those, I’d probably answer earnestly for a while before inevitably falling into aporia myself.</p>\n<p>And this method of questioning wasn’t just for the Sophists — Socrates applied it to himself too. After repeating this process over and over, he arrived at a single realization:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only thing I know is that I know nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a statement directed at himself as much as at the Sophists. Neither you nor I truly know anything — but at least I know that I don’t know.</p>\n<p>And Socrates’ conclusion isn’t wrong, either. You have to acknowledge your ignorance before you can pursue deeper truth. Someone who thinks “I already know this” won’t dig any deeper into the subject.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the Sophists didn’t take kindly to Socrates’ attitude. He was eventually charged with “corrupting the youth and undermining Athenian traditions.”</p>\n<p>He could have survived the trial by playing politics and talking his way out, but Socrates refused to bend his convictions. He gave a provocative defense that antagonized the jury, effectively sealing his own fate with a death sentence. <del>(He could have applied for exile to another city-state, but he chose to drink the poison instead — a true hard case…)</del></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"socrates\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/0913d/socrates.jpg 160w,\n/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/cb69c/socrates.jpg 320w,\n/static/be86a1241af4ff8684b6f216b7dbfde3/b4294/socrates.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>In the end, this man chose the hemlock</small>\n</center>\n<p>Even someone as brilliant as Socrates, after all that deliberation, arrived at “I know nothing.” It’s an almost absurdly anticlimactic conclusion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>After this long exploration, my question has merely shifted from “What is knowledge?” to “Do we truly know the things we think we know?” — without actually finding an answer.</p>\n<p>I suppose it makes sense that I can’t easily answer a question that even Socrates — counted among the great sages of history — could only resolve with such an empty-sounding conclusion.

It’s not hard to conjure up. I’m a frontend developer, so let’s imagine a situation where I need to build a simple web frontend application.</p>\n<p>First, you need to pick a library or framework that connects your view and model to render the UI. The big names are React, Vue, and Angular. Most people go with React since it has the largest ecosystem, but honestly, you can build whatever you need with any of them.</p>\n<p>Modern web applications demand complex client-side state management, so you’ll also need to choose a state management library. The popular ones are Redux and MobX — pick your flavor. If you chose Vue as your UI framework, just use Vuex for the sake of your mental health.</p>\n<p>If you need to manage complex object state, immutability helpers like ImmutableJS or Immer would be nice to have.</p>\n<p>If you’re using Redux, you’ll also need to pick an async middleware — redux-thunk, redux-saga, and the like. Or how about RxJS, which has been gaining traction lately? It even comes as a Redux middleware via redux-observable.</p>\n<p>For package management, choose between npm or yarn. For unit testing, Mocha or Jest. For your eslint config, pick <code class=\"language-text\">airbnb</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">standard</code> and customize to taste.</p>\n<p>Oh, and come to think of it, using TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript might not be a bad idea — since we’re building this, might as well make it robust. In that case, we need to check whether all those libraries above support TypeScript.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 512px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/36dd4/what.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"what\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/36dd4/what.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/0913d/what.jpg 160w,\n/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/cb69c/what.jpg 320w,\n/static/07726d5ba582507933d65f0734e10118/36dd4/what.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>I thought we were building a \"simple\" application...?</small>\n</center>\n<p>All those tools I just rattled off aren’t me showing off — they’re things frontend developers actually deliberate over every time they start a project at work or on the side. None of them are strictly required, but once you learn them, they boost productivity so much that most frontend developers use some combination of them.</p>\n<p>And to actually use these tools properly, you also need knowledge of JavaScript internals like closures and the event loop, virtual DOM, data binding, MVVM patterns, Flux patterns, functional programming, and more.</p>\n<p>There’s been an explosion of new things in frontend lately, but developers in other specializations face a similarly large body of knowledge. It’s just specialized differently for each discipline.</p>\n<p>The point of this long preamble is really just one thing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Nobody can kindly teach you all of this.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"you-have-to-find-information-yourself\" style=\"position:relative;\">You Have to Find Information Yourself<a href=\"#you-have-to-find-information-yourself\" aria-label=\"you have to find information yourself permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Does anyone exist who could teach you all of that? Personally, I don’t think so.</p>\n<p>If programming were like mathematics — where a formula created 100 years ago is still used 100 years later — then maybe someone could build a systematic curriculum covering everything. But many of the tools I mentioned might not even exist next year. The lifespan of this knowledge is extremely short.</p>\n<p>And it’s hard to say which of these overlapping tools is “better” or “worse.” Go ask a nearby frontend developer “Is React better or Vue?” What do you think they’ll say? Probably that both are good, both are bad, or they’ll just pick their favorite.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, programming is a field where building a specific curriculum is quite difficult. Sure, you can create a curriculum for absolute beginners, but beyond that, curricula become somewhat pointless.</p>\n<p>Imagine spending three months at a bootcamp diligently learning Vue, only to join a company that uses React. You can’t exactly ask the company for time off to go learn React for another three months.</p>\n<p>In the end, developers have no choice but to get comfortable finding and learning information on their own, tailored to their organization’s needs and the technologies they want to explore. That’s why “just Google it” is the answer to so many developer questions.</p>\n<p>But actively learning by finding information on Google and Stack Overflow requires the ability to choose effective search keywords and the discernment to distinguish good information from bad — which makes it harder than it sounds. <del>(You also need decent English.)</del> And nobody can teach you this; you have to practice and figure it out yourself.</p>\n<p>But since I can’t just tell someone to “go Google things” when they don’t even know what to search for or what to study, let me share a very simple method I use frequently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-keywords-are-connected\" style=\"position:relative;\">All Keywords Are Connected<a href=\"#all-keywords-are-connected\" aria-label=\"all keywords are connected permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>When we study, we typically “memorize.” Memorization-based learning allows us to quickly absorb narrow pieces of information, making it a pretty good fit for developers who are constantly chasing new trends.</p>\n<p>You know — memorizing the four characteristics of pure functions, or the features and trade-offs of TCP vs. UDP. Or when a new library or framework comes out, skimming the docs and coding along is also a form of memorization.</p>\n<p>But while memorization is fast, it has a downside: keyword acquisition is fragmented. By “fragmented,” I mean that learning one keyword doesn’t naturally lead you to the next.

If you’re learning under time pressure, you can stop here and start coding. But if knowing that <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> exists isn’t enough to satisfy you, this is where you should throw out a new question.</p>\n<p>When I first encountered React’s functional components and learned about this hook, I had this very basic curiosity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does the <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> hook store state?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This isn’t some profound question. It’s just taking one small step of curiosity beyond the simple memorization of ”<code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> lets you store state in functional components.”</p>\n<p>Someone with deep JavaScript knowledge might have had a more advanced question right away, but at the time, I had zero intuition about how the hook worked internally.</p>\n<p>Anyway — you’ve asked yourself a question, so now you need to find the answer. There’s no teacher beside you, so let’s just search this question on Google as-is.</p>\n<p>My search query: “how does useState work.” Search keywords aren’t a paid resource — just type whatever comes to mind. There’s no special skill required for Googling.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/3d405/googled.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 105.62500000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"googled\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/6af66/googled.png\" srcset=\"/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/69538/googled.png 160w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/72799/googled.png 320w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/6af66/googled.png 640w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/d9199/googled.png 960w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/21b4d/googled.png 1280w,\n/static/9fdff19c7231a0991eca5fffd513c04b/3d405/googled.png 1348w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>The Google gods know all things</small>\n</center>\n<p>Searching this keyword, I can already see detailed posts where others have explained React hooks. If searching in your native language doesn’t yield results, try an English query like “principle of useState” — you’ll almost always find what you need. The gap in available information between searching in English versus other languages is enormous, so it’s worth building the habit of searching in English.</p>\n<p>React’s <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> hook actually uses JavaScript closures to store state within a function. With a bit of searching, you’ll discover the keyword “closure.”</p>\n<p>Once you’ve found this new keyword, if you already know what closures are, you might try implementing <code class=\"language-text\">useState</code> from scratch as a learning exercise. If not, search for “JavaScript closures” and study up. While studying closures, you’ll probably find another question to ask, which will lead you to yet another keyword deeper down.</p>\n<p>Some readers might think, “I can barely keep up with learning and using things as-is — when am I supposed to understand the underlying principles?” But there’s an important distinction between “the ability to understand a keyword” and “the ability to find a keyword.”</p>\n<p>The ability to understand a keyword quickly can’t be developed in a short time with a few tips. It requires a baseline level of domain knowledge.</p>\n<p>But “the ability to find keywords” is different. It doesn’t require any particular level of knowledge — just fingers that can type a search query into Google. And if you discover a new keyword that feels too difficult to understand right now, you don’t have to learn it immediately.</p>\n<p>The smallest value of acquiring a keyword is knowing that “something like this exists in the world.” If you know the keyword exists, you can come back to it later when your knowledge has deepened. Then you study it, ask more questions, discover the next keyword, and repeat. <del>(If you work as a developer, the day will come when you need to learn that keyword.)</del></p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I’ll admit the title “Question Driven Thinking” sounds grandiose, but as I mentioned, learning through questions isn’t something I invented — it’s a well-known learning method.</p>\n<p>This approach of gradually finding answers through questions has been used since ancient Greece.

From the first in 1784 to the fourth in the present day, the gaps keep getting shorter. Human technological progress doesn’t grow linearly — it grows exponentially.</p>\n<p>Using industrial revolutions as examples might feel too macro to relate to. But the small changes engineers notice day to day accumulate across the industry, creating synergies that eventually break through critical thresholds. An engineer’s ability to sense and keep up with these changes shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>\n<p>In other words, here’s what “falling behind” actually means. Imagine a master farmer from the Silla dynasty in ancient Korea. That person could still make a living with their skills 1,000 years later in the Joseon dynasty — despite a millennium-wide gap. By contrast, the human “computers” who performed calculations at the US Department of Defense in the 1970s hold a job title that no longer exists today.</p>\n<p>This pace of change will only accelerate. That’s why people say “study or get left behind.” The shift from physical servers to cloud computing might seem like a minor detail, but if you brush it off and move on, within just two years you’ll find it increasingly difficult to follow the new paradigms that build on top of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"changes-in-it-have-outsized-impact\" style=\"position:relative;\">Changes in IT Have Outsized Impact<a href=\"#changes-in-it-have-outsized-impact\" aria-label=\"changes in it have outsized impact permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Of course, knowledge in fields outside IT also evolves over time. But the IT industry doesn’t just change quickly — it frequently undergoes changes so fundamental that entire paradigms get flipped upside down.</p>\n<p>In physics, for instance, when an existing theory is disproven and a new one is proposed, it can be significant enough to rewrite textbooks worldwide. But such events are rare. A famous example is Einstein’s theory of relativity, which proposed that time flows differently depending on the observer’s state — overturning thousands of years of assuming time was absolute.</p>\n<p>In law, new legislation requires studying updated statutes and reviewing relevant precedents. This happens frequently as governments amend laws large and small, but these changes rarely overturn the fundamental paradigms that existing laws operate under. Proposing something that radical is extremely difficult.</p>\n<p>In IT, however, changes that are both rapid and paradigm-shifting happen regularly. A few examples: the shift from jQuery to AngularJS, from MVC to Flux, the introduction of Docker containers, the emergence of serverless architecture. Though I didn’t experience it firsthand, I imagine it was similar when AWS first launched cloud computing services.</p>\n<p>In IT, there have been many cases where you need to completely abandon existing paradigms and focus entirely on something new to understand what’s happening. Each time, the ecosystem underwent significant transformation — affecting not just developers but everyone’s daily lives.</p>\n<p>You might wonder “how do these things affect everyday life?” Here are a few examples.</p>\n<p>Thanks to these changes, many companies no longer buy physical servers and host them in data centers. They use cloud computing instead, which reduces the resources needed for server management and enables flexible traffic handling — significantly lowering the operational burden.</p>\n<p>Today, knowing just JavaScript lets you build web clients, mobile apps, desktop applications, and servers. This means developers don’t need to learn multiple languages to build the service they want.</p>\n<p>And by paying a modest fee to a cloud computing provider, you can set up and manage backend infrastructure with just a few clicks — making it possible for a single developer to operate a massive system.</p>\n<p>These changes have lowered the barrier to programming dramatically compared to the past, ushering in an era where anyone with an idea can take a shot at an IT venture. The result? Tech giants like Google and Facebook that directly impact all of our lives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-study\" style=\"position:relative;\">How I Study<a href=\"#how-i-study\" aria-label=\"how i study permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I’m one of those developers scrambling not to fall behind in this rapid current of technology, so naturally I study regularly. But in this post, rather than stating the obvious fact that you should study, I wanted to share how I actually go about it.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard many developers, aspiring developers, and career changers express difficulty with studying. Their challenge isn’t usually the technical difficulty itself — it’s “I don’t know where to start.”</p>\n<p>This is perfectly understandable in an age when information is flooding in from every direction. Before you even begin studying development, there are too many choices to make. Should you learn a language and framework first, or start with computer science fundamentals? Which language? React or Vue? The list of decisions is overwhelming before you’ve even written a line of code.</p>\n<p>And since there’s no single right answer, asking developers around you or posting in communities will likely yield different responses from different people.</p>\n<p>I personally think our tendency toward this kind of paralysis is partly shaped by cultural conditioning. Many of us grew up in educational systems where we studied what we were told to study rather than choosing our own path. Even when choosing a college major, many people pick based on their test scores rather than genuine interest.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/837e8a802f0aa661a955a69427143496/1c72d/exam.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 62.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"exam\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/837e8a802f0aa661a955a69427143496/1c72d/exam.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/837e8a802f0aa661a955a69427143496/0913d/exam.jpg 160w,\n/static/837e8a802f0aa661a955a69427143496/cb69c/exam.jpg 320w,\n/static/837e8a802f0aa661a955a69427143496/1c72d/exam.jpg 590w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    Standardized tests matter, but failing them doesn't ruin your life.<br>\n    I nearly didn't get into college because I spent my time goofing off — and I turned out fine.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>After college, you follow the crowd — getting certifications, scoring well on standardized tests, doing internships, preparing for job applications.

There’s no good answer because no matter where you start, there’s too much to learn. What matters isn’t deciding what to study — it’s deciding <strong>what to build</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decide-what-you-want-to-build-first\" style=\"position:relative;\">Decide What You Want to Build First<a href=\"#decide-what-you-want-to-build-first\" aria-label=\"decide what you want to build first permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>When someone tells me they don’t know what to study, the first question I always ask is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, have you thought about what you want to build?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Surprisingly, 9 out of 10 people answer “not really.” They’re trying to start studying development without knowing what they want to create. This approach leads to two problems:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Without a clear goal, you have no idea when you’re “done” studying.</li>\n<li>You can’t immediately apply what you learn, so studying isn’t fun.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>The first problem is the more serious one. When there’s no goal, or just a vague one like “I want to be good at development,” no amount of studying will tell you where the finish line is. In these cases, people often start with passion but gradually burn out.</p>\n<p>Studying is really about how well you can focus. It’s better to finish one subject in a month and move on to the next than to spread yourself across 100 subjects over ten years. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll dabble in this and that, hit a wall, and give up.</p>\n<p>The second problem is essentially an extension of the first. It’s just not fun. It’s similar to why English and math classes in school felt tedious — nobody told you what these subjects were actually for, just to memorize everything. Knowledge shines when applied in the right context. Knowledge crammed solely for exams has little lasting value.</p>\n<p>So when I want to learn a particular technology, I first think about what I could build with it. If you think hard enough, at least one or two ideas always come up. Alternatively, you can start with something you want to build and study the necessary technology to make it. The key point is actually using the technology.</p>\n<p>I personally prefer the latter approach. I decide what I want to build first, then study whatever knowledge is required. Sometimes that means analyzing research papers, sometimes it means pulling out a college textbook I barely touched, sometimes it means reading official documentation all night — but the desire to finish the project I’ve started keeps me studying to the end.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/d9ed5/solar_system.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 51.25000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"solar system\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/6af66/solar_system.png\" srcset=\"/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/69538/solar_system.png 160w,\n/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/72799/solar_system.png 320w,\n/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/6af66/solar_system.png 640w,\n/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/d9199/solar_system.png 960w,\n/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/21b4d/solar_system.png 1280w,\n/static/527b34da29027329910693542ff9061f/d9ed5/solar_system.png 2880w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>A solar system simulator I've been building since 2017</small>\n</center>\n<p>I’ve loved space since I was a kid, and from the moment I started coding, I wanted to simulate the movements of celestial bodies in our solar system. But building it required understanding computer graphics, mathematics, and astrophysics — which felt so daunting that I didn’t touch it for years.</p>\n<p>Then one day, a few years into my career, I realized that at this rate, I’d never start the project. So I just dove in — studying Keplerian orbital equations and linear algebra — and eventually completed the project I’d been dreaming about for so long.</p>\n<p>It was incredibly difficult. I’m not a huge fan of math, so I wasn’t even sure I could build something that was essentially wall-to-wall mathematics. I thought it would take about a year to study and build the basic framework. A year? I finished it in three months.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean I fully understood Keplerian orbital equations in three months. I understood them just enough to build a solar system simulator.

I just studied consistently, cutting into my sleep every night. When equations didn’t make sense, I’d port them to code and step through them line by line. And this kind of grinding study is something anyone can do when they have a goal they truly want to achieve. <small>(A truly smart person would have been buying Bitcoin instead of building a solar system simulator.)</small></p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 480px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8204f45c9143ce76f9e7162e029588f9/e85cb/exam_fail.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 110.00000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"exam fail\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8204f45c9143ce76f9e7162e029588f9/e85cb/exam_fail.png\" srcset=\"/static/8204f45c9143ce76f9e7162e029588f9/69538/exam_fail.png 160w,\n/static/8204f45c9143ce76f9e7162e029588f9/72799/exam_fail.png 320w,\n/static/8204f45c9143ce76f9e7162e029588f9/e85cb/exam_fail.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>I get destroyed in interviews and exams too, just like the rest of you.</small>\n</center>\n<p>At the end of the day, studying is about acquiring knowledge you need to build something. Studying without any goal is no different from cramming for standardized tests in high school. We need goals that are more fundamental than just “do well on the exam.”</p>\n<p>By giving yourself a goal, you create strong motivation — and that motivation becomes the driving force for sustained, persistent learning. Before jumping into studying, first figure out why you need to study this in the first place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"study-with-your-own-convictions\" style=\"position:relative;\">Study With Your Own Convictions<a href=\"#study-with-your-own-convictions\" aria-label=\"study with your own convictions permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I just talked about the importance of having a clear goal. The “decide what you want to build” approach I described is one way to create necessity — even for knowledge you don’t immediately need — and use that necessity as motivation.</p>\n<p>But that method is stronger at preventing you from quitting midway. We also need to think about what knowledge is truly necessary for us. The definition of “necessary,” however, differs from person to person.</p>\n<p>For me, the priority is strictly “knowledge I need to build something.” I don’t care how trendy a technology is or if it has 90% market share — if it doesn’t interest me, I don’t study it. If I later join a company that needs that skill, I’ll learn it then.</p>\n<p>Looking at the projects I’ve built, it’s obvious — as a frontend developer, the chances of using knowledge gained from building a solar system simulator or audio effects processor are pretty low. So when interviewers ask “why did you build this?”, there’s no grand reason. I just say “personal satisfaction.”</p>\n<p>Since what counts as “necessary knowledge” varies by person, I can’t tell you what you should or shouldn’t study. But what I do want to say is that you need clear personal convictions when it comes to learning.</p>\n<p>To illustrate what I mean by personal convictions, consider people studying <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flutter</a>, Google’s cross-platform framework. They’re probably not studying it just because it’s trending. Flutter wasn’t even that well-known at the time, and its language, Dart, has limited use outside Flutter itself.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d2d2f9e4b4a0323e69db7fd322c23039/5a190/worst_languages.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 105%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"worst languages\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/d2d2f9e4b4a0323e69db7fd322c23039/6af66/worst_languages.png\" srcset=\"/static/d2d2f9e4b4a0323e69db7fd322c23039/69538/worst_languages.png 160w,\n/static/d2d2f9e4b4a0323e69db7fd322c23039/72799/worst_languages.png 320w,\n/static/d2d2f9e4b4a0323e69db7fd322c23039/6af66/worst_languages.png 640w,\n/static/d2d2f9e4b4a0323e69db7fd322c23039/5a190/worst_languages.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    Codementor's 2018 survey of languages not recommended for learning.<br>\n    Dart proudly topped all three categories.

There’s no royal road to learning. You just get better by doing it consistently. What I wanted to share in this post was how to study a little more efficiently.</p>\n<p>The two points I made above can be summarized like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Know why you’re studying something before you start.</li>\n<li>Just because everyone’s using React doesn’t mean you have to use React too.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Point 1 is about motivation, which I emphasized repeatedly. Whether it’s studying or anything else, if you’re not properly motivated, the work becomes joyless and mechanical. There are limits to sheer effort alone.</p>\n<p>Point 2 might be more controversial. Here’s my take: if everyone’s using React and you study it too, getting a job might be easier. But most technologies — especially frameworks — are products of their time, reflecting the paradigms and constraints of the moment. Who can say that something better and more revolutionary than React won’t appear in 2-3 years?</p>\n<p>The “React or Vue?” questions you see in every community come from people trying to figure out which choice maximizes return on investment. Just pick whichever one has a name or logo you like and start studying. In three years, you might have to ditch both and learn something entirely new anyway.</p>\n<p>What matters is “what do I need right now?” — not blindly following a technology just because it’s popular or because people say it’s good. Of course, “lots of people use it” can be a valid reason. What I’m cautioning against is the kind of decision where you’re just following the crowd without your own reasoning.</p>\n<p>If someone says a framework is good and that makes you want to study it, you should at least evaluate for yourself what specifically makes it good — and whether it actually is. There’s a reason interviewers ask “why did you study this?” and “what did you find good and bad about it?” when you bring up a technology.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, this post is absolutely not the definitive answer. I found a study method that works for me, and yours might be the same or completely different. The most important thing is to keep asking yourself what excites you, when you focus best, and what truly motivates you. This is just my personal take, but I hope it helps anyone who’s struggling with where to start when studying development.</p>\n<p>That wraps up this post on how developers survive through learning.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20190826-how-does-developer-study-en","path":"/2019/08/26/how-does-developer-study/en/","lang":"en"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How Developers Survive Through Learning","subTitle":"Don't study by following the crowd — how to take ownership of your learning as a developer","date":"Aug 26, 2019","categories":["Essay"],"tags":["Learning","Developer","Developer Study","Developer Interview","How to Study"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/3a812/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/3a812/thumbnail.jpg 320w,\n/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/4b287/thumbnail.jpg 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/fc5c5/thumbnail.webp 320w,\n/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/e9225/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":320}}},"jumbotron":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/2d839/thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/2d839/thumbnail.jpg 750w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/64e0507e8fb8581c6f1b9ad7488d1b7d/b384d/thumbnail.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"How to Study","lang":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3523904809","650499039"],"slicesMap":{}}
