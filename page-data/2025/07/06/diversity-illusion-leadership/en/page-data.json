The belief that people from diverse backgrounds create synergy and that different perspectives drive innovation has become common wisdom. In the tech industry especially, Diversity &#x26; Inclusion has established itself as a core keyword of organizational culture.</p>\n<p>But when you actually work as a leader, you realize that these idealistic principles create surprisingly complex dilemmas. Should we unconditionally respect every kind of diversity? When an individual’s choices clash with the organization’s goals, what criteria should a leader use to make decisions?</p>\n<p>In this post, I want to share a specific dilemma I faced while working as a chapter lead in a frontend organization of about 100 people, and the wisdom I found within the limits of respecting diversity.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I’ll explore how Buddhist philosophy, particularly dependent origination and the Middle Way, can offer practical insights for running modern organizations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-the-dilemma-begins\" style=\"position:relative;\">Where the dilemma begins<a href=\"#where-the-dilemma-begins\" aria-label=\"where the dilemma begins permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As a leader striving to build an excellent organization, I need to support and encourage my team members’ growth. But with 100 people in the group, there are inevitably those who think differently.</p>\n<p>Recently, one team member sent me into deep contemplation. They had outstanding technical skills, executed their current responsibilities flawlessly, and earned the trust of their colleagues. From my perspective, they’d be a perfect fit for a lead role. But they declined any such additional responsibility.</p>\n<p>Whenever I suggested new challenges for their growth, they would calmly respond:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’m not really thinking about that right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather focus on other things.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If they had been underperforming while also refusing to grow, it would have been a clear-cut problem. But the fact that they were already doing excellent work made it all the more ambiguous.</p>\n<p>This experience raised fundamental questions for me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Is it right to set higher goals for someone who’s already doing well enough?”</p>\n<p>And: “How far should the principle of respecting individual diversity and choice extend?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m sure many of you have wrestled with similar dilemmas. Facing this kind of situation, we tend to oscillate between two extremes: “We must unconditionally respect diversity” on one side, and “The organization’s goals require uniformity” on the other.</p>\n<p>Through this experience, I realized I needed a perspective beyond these binary choices. What traps might be hiding within the notion of “respecting diversity” that we so readily take for granted?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-trap-of-respecting-diversity\" style=\"position:relative;\">The trap of respecting diversity<a href=\"#the-trap-of-respecting-diversity\" aria-label=\"the trap of respecting diversity permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As I dug deeper into this issue, I realized that diversity is often approached in a binary way — people tend to simply divide it into either respecting diversity or not.</p>\n<p>But reality isn’t that simple. Respecting diversity isn’t an absolute principle; it should be approached as a question of how much an organization or society can accommodate given its specific characteristics.</p>\n<p>This connects to the truth revealed by the Buddhist concept of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda). Because all phenomena exist in mutual dependence, neither absolute freedom nor absolute control is possible. <small>(I know bringing up Buddhism out of nowhere might seem surprising, but the stories from Buddhist teachings actually offer a great deal of life wisdom.)</small></p>\n<p>Take the South Korean constitution as an example. South Korea is a democracy that guarantees its citizens’ freedom, yet Article 8 of the constitution allows for the dissolution of political parties under certain conditions. This means that when elements threaten the basic democratic order, freedom cannot be granted without limits. In other words, even the state doesn’t unconditionally respect all forms of diversity.</p>\n<p>The same principle applies to organizations. Should a company tolerate an employee who doesn’t keep regular working hours or insists on working from home despite an uncooperative attitude, simply because “we respect diversity”? Diversity deserves respect, but when it conflicts with the organization’s operations and objectives, limits are inevitable.</p>\n<p>Through these observations, I arrived at a conclusion: unconditional respect for diversity is an illusion that cannot exist.</p>\n<p>So is diversity always a bad thing? Of course not. Diversity clearly has both light and shadow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-light-and-shadow-of-diversity\" style=\"position:relative;\">The light and shadow of diversity<a href=\"#the-light-and-shadow-of-diversity\" aria-label=\"the light and shadow of diversity permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>The positive effects of diversity are real. When team members with varied backgrounds come together, new ideas emerge and more approaches to problem-solving open up. Working in a frontend organization of about 100 people, I’ve met an incredible variety of developers and collaborated closely with non-developer colleagues. Through this, I’ve felt the synergy created when talented, diverse people come together.</p>\n<p>But diversity doesn’t always produce positive outcomes. As differences in opinion grow, the time and energy required for coordination increase exponentially, and team cohesion can weaken in the process. As Buddhist dependent origination teaches, because all phenomena are interdependent, a change in one element can have unexpected effects on the entire system.</p>\n<p>Understanding this dual nature of diversity allowed me to look at the team member I mentioned earlier from a new angle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anattā-non-self-and-the-possibility-of-change\" style=\"position:relative;\">Anattā (non-self) and the possibility of change<a href=\"#anatt%C4%81-non-self-and-the-possibility-of-change\" aria-label=\"anattā non self and the possibility of change permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Reflecting more deeply on this team member, I was reminded of the Buddhist concept of anattā — non-self. Individual diversity is not a fixed, unchanging attribute; it shifts constantly. Just because that team member doesn’t want to grow right now doesn’t mean they never will.</p>\n<p>As a leader, I’ve always tried to present higher-level goals to my team members. This wasn’t merely about driving performance — it came from a genuine desire to draw out each person’s potential and help them grow as professionals. But through this process, I reached a conclusion: growth cannot be forced. You can propose growth, but the final decision and responsibility belong to the individual.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I realized that what’s needed is the wisdom to respect someone’s choice in the present moment while keeping the door open for change and waiting patiently.</p>\n<p>But simply waiting isn’t the answer either. As a leader, I also needed concrete principles for how to communicate and act.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wisdom-from-the-noble-eightfold-path-right-communication\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wisdom from the Noble Eightfold Path: right communication<a href=\"#wisdom-from-the-noble-eightfold-path-right-communication\" aria-label=\"wisdom from the noble eightfold path right communication permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>What helped me here was the Buddhist Noble Eightfold Path — the eight practices the Buddha prescribed as the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>Among these, Right Speech and Right Action clearly illustrate the principles a leader should follow when communicating with team members.</p>\n<p>Right Speech means avoiding lies, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle chatter, and instead speaking truthfully and helpfully. Right Action means behaving in ways that don’t harm yourself or others.</p>\n<p>When proposing growth, it’s crucial to use truthful, constructive language rather than criticism or coercion, and to act in ways that benefit both the individual and the organization. The key isn’t pushing some abstract goal of “getting better” — it’s concretely showing what that growth means and what positive impact it can have.</p>\n<p>But when you try to put these principles into practice, you inevitably face another complex problem: how to balance your own values as a leader with your team members’ diverse perspectives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leadership-through-compassion-and-skillful-means\" style=\"position:relative;\">Leadership through compassion and skillful means<a href=\"#leadership-through-compassion-and-skillful-means\" aria-label=\"leadership through compassion and skillful means permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This dilemma resembles the clash of political ideologies. Progressive and conservative — each has its own strengths and weaknesses. It’s not a matter of right versus wrong, but a difference in which direction to pursue. The same goes for organizational culture. Even if I hold certain beliefs and values as a leader, is it justified to impose them on my team? Yet if I allow total freedom in everything, the organization may descend into chaos.</p>\n<p>In Buddhism, compassion (karuṇā) isn’t mere sympathy. It’s genuinely helping others find true well-being. I believe my desire for my team members’ growth is an expression of this same compassion. And through the wisdom of skillful means (upāya), different approaches should be used for each person based on their situation and disposition.</p>\n<p>Rather than applying the same yardstick to everyone, it’s about understanding individual contexts and finding the appropriate method for each.</p>\n<p>As I examined these various Buddhist principles, I realized they all converge on a single core idea: balance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-middle-way\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Middle Way<a href=\"#the-middle-way\" aria-label=\"the middle way permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>In the end, just as respecting diversity matters, so does maintaining certain standards and order to achieve organizational goals.</p>\n<p>So how do you strike this balance? One conclusion I’ve reached from running my team is that “not all diversity must be unconditionally respected.” This doesn’t mean diversity should be restricted — it means diversity should be channeled in a direction consistent with the organization’s fundamental purpose.</p>\n<p>As a leader, I strive to provide a safe environment where team members’ diversity is respected, while also setting clear standards and guidelines for effective collaboration. From a Buddhist perspective, a leader is both someone who supports team members in growing at their own pace and in their own way, and someone who sets direction and guides them toward it.</p>\n<p>Balancing these two roles isn’t easy, but I think it’s the Middle Way that yields the best results for both the organization and the individual.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\">Closing thoughts<a href=\"#closing-thoughts\" aria-label=\"closing thoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Diversity is an essential ingredient for organizational growth.

도전을 제안하면 그 분은 담담하게 이렇게 답했다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“지금은 딱히 생각이 없어요.”</p>\n<p>“다른 것에 집중하고 싶어서요.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>만약 그 분이 역량이 부족하면서 성장도 하지 않는다면 명확히 문제가 되겠지만, 이미 잘하고 있는 사람이라서 더욱 애매했다.</p>\n<p>이 경험은 필자에게 근본적인 질문들을 던졌다.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“충분히 잘 하고 있는 사람에게 더 높은 목표를 제시하는 것이 과연 옳은가?”</p>\n<p>그리고 “개인의 다양성과 선택을 존중해야 한다는 원칙은 어디까지 적용되어야 하는가?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>독자 여러분도 비슷한 고민을 해본 적이 있을 것이다. 이런 딜레마 앞에서 우리는 흔히 두 가지 극단적인 선택지 사이에서 헤매게 된다. 하나는 “다양성을 무조건 존중해야 한다”는 입장이고, 다른 하나는 “조직의 목표를 위해서는 통일성이 필요하다”는 입장이다.</p>\n<p>이 경험을 통해 필자는 이런 극단적 선택지를 넘어서는 새로운 관점이 필요하다는 것을 깨달았다. 그 팀원의 상황을 더 깊이 들여다보면서, 다양성이라는 개념 자체를 보다 세밀하게 살펴볼 필요가 있다는 생각이 들었다. 과연 우리가 흔히 당연하게 여기는 다양성 존중이라는 개념에는 어떤 함정이 숨어있을까?</p>\n<h2 id=\"다양성-존중의-함정\" style=\"position:relative;\">다양성 존중의 함정<a

단순하지 않으며, 다양성을 존중해야 한다는 것은 절대적인 원칙이 아니라 조직이나 사회의 특성에 따라 어느 정도까지 포용할 수 있는가의 문제로 접근해야 한다.</p>\n<p>이는 불교의 연기법(緣起法)이 보여주는 진리와 맞닿아 있다. 모든 현상은 서로 의존하며 존재하기 때문에, 절대적인 자유나 절대적인 통제 모두 불가능하다는 것이다. <small>(뜬금없이 불교 얘기를 해서 당황스럽겠지만, 의외로 불교에서 말하는 에피소드들이 삶의 지혜를 많이 알려준다)</small></p>\n<p>대한민국의 헌법을 예로 들어보자. 대한민국은 국민의 자유를 보장하는 민주주의 국가이지만, 헌법 제8조에서는 특정 조건에 따라 위헌 정당을 해산할 수 있도록 하고 있다. 이는 민주적 기본 질서를 위협하는 요소가 있을 경우, 자유를 무제한으로 허용할 수 없다는 것을 의미한다. 즉, 국가조차도 모든 다양성을 무조건적으로 존중하지는 않는다는 것이다.</p>\n<p>이와 같은 원리는 조직에도 동일하게 적용된다. 예를 들어, 회사가 다양성을 존중해야 한다는 이유만으로 정해진 근무 시간을 지키지 않거나, 업무 태도가 성실하지 않음에도 불구하고 재택근무만을 주장하는 직원까지 포용해야 할까? 다양성은 존중받아야 하지만, 그것이 조직의 운영과 목표에 부합하지 않을 때는 결국 제한될 수밖에 없다.</p>\n<p>이러한 관찰을 통해 필자는 무조건적인 다양성 존중이라는 것은 존재할 수 없는 허상이라는 결론에 도달했다.</p>\n<p>그렇다면 다양성은 정말 무조건 나쁜 것일까? 물론 그런 것은 아니다. 다양성에는 분명히 빛과 그림자가

팀원들이 모였을 때, 새로운 아이디어가 탄생하고, 문제를 해결하는 데 있어 더 많은 접근법을 시도할 수 있다는 것이다. 필자가 100명 규모의 프론트엔드 조직에서 일하면서 평소 굉장히 다양한 개발자들을 만나고, 개발자가 아닌 동료들과도 밀접한 협업을 수행하는 과정에서 탁월한 역량을 가진 다양한 사람들이 모여 만들어내는 시너지를 느낄 수 있었다.</p>\n<p>하지만 이러한 다양성이 항상 긍정적인 결과만을 가져오는 것은 아니다. 의견 차이가 커질수록 조율에 드는 시간과 에너지가 기하급수적으로 증가하며, 이 과정에서 팀의 결속력이 약해지기도 한다. 이는 불교의 연기법이 보여주는 바와 같이, 모든 현상이 상호의존적이기 때문에 한 요소의 변화가 전체 시스템에 예상치 못한 영향을 미칠 수 있음을 의미한다.</p>\n<p>다양성의 이런 양면성을 이해하고 나니, 앞서 언급한 팀원에 대한 고민도 새로운 시각에서 바라볼 수 있게 되었다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"무아無我와-성장의-변화-가능성\" style=\"position:relative;\">무아(無我)와 성장의 변화 가능성<a

속성이 아니라 끊임없이 변화하는 것이다. 그 팀원이 현재 성장을 원하지 않는다고 해서 미래에도 그럴 것이라고 단정할 수는 없다.</p>\n<p>필자는 리더로서 항상 팀원들에게 더 높은 수준의 목표를 제시하려고 노력해왔다. 이는 단순히 성과를 내기 위한 것이 아니라, 각자가 가진 잠재력을 최대한 끌어내어 프로페셔널로서 더 성장하길 바라는 마음에서였다. 그러나 이 과정에서 “성장은 강요될 수 없는 것”이라는 결론에 도달했다. 성장을 제안할 수는 있지만, 그 선택의 최종 결정과 책임은 개인의 몫이라는 점을 깨달았다.</p>\n<p>결국 필자는 이 순간의 선택을 존중하면서도, 변화의 가능성을 열어두고 인내심을 갖고 기다리는 지혜가 필요하다는 것을 깨달았다.</p>\n<p>하지만 단순히 기다리기만 하는 것이 능사는

구체적으로 제시한 것이다.</p>\n<p>이 중에서도 정어(正語)와 정업(正業)은 리더가 팀원과 소통할 때 지켜야 할 원칙을 명확하게 보여준다.</p>\n<p>정어(正語)는 “올바른 말”을 의미한다. 거짓말, 이간질, 욕설, 쓸데없는 말을 하지 않고, 진실하고 도움이 되는 말을 해야 한다는 것이다. 정업(正業)은 “올바른 행동”으로, 자신과 타인에게 해가 되지 않는 행동을 하라는 가르침이다.</p>\n<p>성장을 제안할 때는 비난이나 강요가 아닌 진실하고 건설적인 언어를 사용해야 하며, 개인과 조직 모두에게 도움이 되는 방향으로 행동해야 한다는 점이 중요하다. 단순히 더 나아져야 한다는 추상적인 목표가 아니라, 그 성장이 어떤 의미를 가지며 어떤 긍정적 영향을 줄 수 있는지 구체적으로 보여주는 것이 핵심이다.</p>\n<p>그런데 이런 원칙들을 실천하려고 하다 보면, 또 다른 복잡한 문제에 직면하게 된다. 바로 리더 자신의 가치관과 팀원들의 다양한 생각 사이에서 어떤 균형을 잡아야 하는가의 문제다.</p>\n<h2 id=\"자비慈悲와-방편方便의-리더십\" style=\"position:relative;\">자비(慈悲)와 방편(方便)의 리더십<a
