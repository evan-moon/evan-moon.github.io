So why does a company hire developers?</p>\n<p>Obviously, to make money using your programming skills. As everyone knows, a company is fundamentally a profit-seeking organization, so the salary they pay you is an investment. If a company pays you $50,000 a year, they naturally expect you to generate at least that much — or more — in value.</p>\n<p>In other words, a developer isn’t just someone who needs to be good at programming.

The only difference is that what we produce has shifted from physical goods to software. And a craftsperson isn’t just responsible for product quality — they must simultaneously care about real user satisfaction, the company’s business requirements, and much more.</p>\n<p>In other words, a profit-seeking organization doesn’t just need someone who’s good at programming. It needs someone who can use programming to satisfy users and generate the revenue that follows.</p>\n<p>That’s why many organizations look for more than just programming skills when hiring good craftspeople. They also look for smooth collaboration with stakeholders, leadership, business insight, understanding of user experience, and various other skills needed for effective product development.</p>\n<p>Moreover, things like collaboration skills and UX understanding may not generate immediate revenue, but in the long run they significantly impact the company’s brand and culture, and can ultimately transform how the organization works and performs. Serious organizations don’t neglect these factors.</p>\n<p>In short, a developer isn’t just someone who programs — they’re one of many team members racing to make their organization’s product succeed in the market. That’s why developers shouldn’t focus solely on programming, but should develop a broad perspective that encompasses the organization’s business challenges as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-do-developers-pursue-good-design\" style=\"position:relative;\">Why Do Developers Pursue Good Design?<a href=\"#why-do-developers-pursue-good-design\" aria-label=\"why do developers pursue good design permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>When you work as a developer, you can’t help wanting to invest the time for good architecture — it’s your baby, after all.</p>\n<p>Developers know from experience that cutting corners on design today creates debt that boomerangs back eventually. The classic example is the “legacy code” meme that’s ubiquitous among developers.</p>\n<p>Code with poor readability and unclear control flow harbors countless potential bugs. Sometimes bugs occur but slip past tracking tools due to weird exception handling. Poorly designed code can create major pain points for users, and in severe cases, ruin critical user moments and drive them away.</p>\n<p>What’s worse, if you keep piling features on top of bad design without improving it, the bad design only grows. Development isn’t about wiping the slate clean for every new feature — it’s about building on top of what already exists.</p>\n<p>Once design goes off the rails, even a small change can trigger bugs in unexpected places. Developers become increasingly cautious, and the organization’s development velocity gradually slows. Eventually, you might want to add a new feature but literally can’t because the architecture won’t allow it.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 327px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cafdf/no.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 156.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"no\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cafdf/no.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/0913d/no.jpg 160w,\n/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cb69c/no.jpg 320w,\n/static/4ae506992fda7327aecbb04a40446576/cafdf/no.jpg 327w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>How I feel looking at code I wrote a year ago...</small>\n</center>\n<p>Ultimately, developers pursue good design to maintain high code quality, preserve development velocity, and prevent unpredictable bugs.

Just go buy one somewhere else.”</p>\n<p><strong>Customer:</strong> “Fine, I’ll pay full price.

Raw rice doesn’t become cooked just because you rush it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Customer:</strong> “The buyer says it’s fine!

The old man doesn’t care about customers at all — no wonder his business is struggling.</em></p>\n<p><em>…But later, upon closer inspection, the quality of the bat turns out to be extraordinary.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The story ends with the protagonist wanting to go back and apologize to the old man for failing to appreciate his deeper purpose.</p>\n<p>The moral, in a word, is “respect for craftsmanship,” and it’s frequently cited as an example of the mindset makers should have.</p>\n<p>The old man in the story takes immense pride in his whittling skills. He’s probably been doing this for a long time, which means he has clear convictions about his craft. Developers who’ve been in the industry for a long time aren’t much different in that regard.</p>\n<p>But there’s one crucial difference between this heartwarming story and reality. The old man never intended to sell to anyone who didn’t share his values. That’s essentially the same as a developer telling users, “I need to take my time and build a proper architecture, so if you don’t like it, use a different app” — while users are complaining, “Why is this app so slow to update?”</p>\n<p>Viewed this way, the old man doesn’t seem so professional after all. Wouldn’t a true professional find a way to deliver the best possible quality within the timeframe the customer needs — satisfying both the customer and themselves?</p>\n<p>The protagonist in the story watches the old man work and thinks, “It looks done — why does he keep going?” If the old man represents the developer, then the protagonist represents the users.</p>\n<p>And unlike this patient protagonist, real users won’t wait around the moment they think “something’s off.” They won’t marvel at the quality of your carefully designed product either. The moment users sense something is wrong, they’ll abandon your product and switch to another.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-balance-between-business-and-good-design\" style=\"position:relative;\">Finding the Balance Between Business and Good Design<a href=\"#finding-the-balance-between-business-and-good-design\" aria-label=\"finding the balance between business and good design permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>As I’ve discussed, developers need to consider business factors while simultaneously thinking about good application architecture.

Business is always about Cost vs. Benefit.</p>\n<p>You might wonder what costs are involved in just “thinking about design,” but they’re real. Your salaries, server costs, office rent — money flows out of the company’s bank account every single day, even when nothing is happening.</p>\n<p>Labor costs in particular are something many people overlook, and they add up surprisingly fast.

That’s the risk a company takes when developing a product. Plus, if you’re running an A/B test, the feature you’re building right now might be deleted within a week.</p>\n<p>In situations like these, always spending time on design isn’t necessarily the right answer.

The reason might be a client’s demand, a fresh startup that needs to find market fit quickly, or a company that’s genuinely running out of money — but what matters isn’t the reason, it’s that the product needs to ship fast.</p>\n<p>In these situations, developers face a dilemma: invest time in solid design, or build something rough and ship it immediately.</p>\n<p>Of course, as your skills grow, you develop an intuition <del>(forged through years of trial and error)</del> that raises the quality floor even when you’re cutting corners. But less experienced developers might produce genuinely hard-to-follow code.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, developers can clearly see the parts that will become tech debt if not designed properly now.

But what matters is accurately understanding <em>what</em> the current situation actually is.</p>\n<p>If the tight deadline is simply because the PO or client is impatient, there’s certainly room to negotiate. But if there’s a pressing business issue — like an imminent funding round that requires finding market fit fast and painting a pretty revenue graph — then negotiating for more design time isn’t such a great call.</p>\n<p>No matter how thoughtfully a developer designs for the future, if the company runs out of money and shuts down next month, that code disappears anyway. As long as a developer works within a company, the lifespan of everything they produce ultimately depends on the company’s bank balance.</p>\n<p>That’s why, even though programming is a developer’s primary job, they shouldn’t think only about programming.

Users are unpredictable creatures who might suddenly bounce just because a single line of copy changed on a page. But you can’t just build random things and ship them either — the financial risks of labor costs, server costs, and more are too high.</p>\n<p>That’s why many organizations use A/B testing to reduce this risk. No matter how brilliant the people gathered in a room, no matter how long they discuss and deliberate, at the end of the day it’s all just predicting “our users will behave this way.”</p>\n<p>In other words, until you deploy and actually observe how users interact with your product, every opinion is just speculation — which is why you run these tests.</p>\n<p>If the Control (existing version) shows higher conversion after the test, you simply discard the new Variant. If the Variant wins, you discard the Control. Either way, you safely improve conversion rates with minimal risk, regardless of whether your hypothesis was right.</p>\n<p>For effective data analysis, you also need to control variables as much as possible. If you change a bunch of things at once and the metrics improve, but you can’t tell which specific change drove the user behavior, the test becomes meaningless.</p>\n<p>That’s why A/B tests usually keep most features identical and only make small, focused changes to the part being tested. This means that when coding for an A/B test, there will inevitably be a lot of shared logic between Control and Variant.</p>\n<p>Some developers abstract these common parts for an efficient design. But here’s the trap:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the two will eventually <strong>have to be deleted</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you aggressively abstract shared code or split things into separate modules to reduce duplication, you actually increase the number of things to worry about when it’s time to remove the test code — and mistakes during removal can introduce unexpected bugs.</p>\n<p>Moreover, A/B tests often have nearly identical variations down to trivial details. No matter how carefully you abstract, once the test ends and you delete one side, you may be left with pointless abstractions.</p>\n<p>That’s why A/B test code should be built to be as easy to delete as possible. The code you write for a test isn’t something you’ll maintain long-term — it’s something that gets deleted after a week-long test at most.</p>\n<p>You might say “just revert the commit since we have Git,” but that only works when the Control wins. If the new Variant wins, a revert is useless.</p>\n<p>In cases like this, forget abstraction — just copy the entire page, route to <code class=\"language-text\">/test-page/a</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">/test-page/b</code> based on the A/B test variable, and when results come in, cleanly delete the losing page. That might actually be the better design.</p>\n<p>If you develop with a narrow, programming-only perspective without considering these business realities, you might end up doing perfectly solid design work only to receive “overengineering” feedback — which is a truly sad outcome.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>In this post, I’ve talked about the relationship between business and application design. Honestly, more experienced developers probably already know all of this.</p>\n<p>But for developers who are just starting out, it’s common for their overflowing enthusiasm to be channeled entirely into programming-related work — refactoring architecture, adopting new and efficient technologies. When I first started as a developer, I was the same way. I said we needed to refactor all the legacy code without considering any business context, and received feedback to broaden my perspective. <del>(Embarrassingly, at the time I thought the person giving that feedback was just being stubborn…)</del></p>\n<p>Of course, as a developer myself, I get excited about open-for-extension architectures, clearly separated modules, and side-effect-free functions.
