It’s only natural for improved paradigms to emerge over time.</p>\n<p>Personally, I still think OOP is a solid design paradigm. But you might find Functional Programming more efficient and appealing — and that’s completely fine.</p>\n<p>Choosing which paradigm you prefer is a matter of personal freedom. But making good choices requires understanding the trade-offs — what you gain and what you lose — which means even if you choose FP, you still need to understand what OOP is.</p>\n<p>Moreover, OOP has played a crucial role in modern program design from the early 1990s through today. No matter how much attention newer paradigms receive, the fact remains that OOP underpins the design of most programs out there — and that’s one very practical reason to learn it, whether you love it or not. <small>(Major languages like Java, Python, and C++ all support OOP.)</small></p>\n<p>So in this post, let’s take a quick look at what OOP aims to achieve and what concepts make it tick.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-object-oriented-mean\" style=\"position:relative;\">What Does “Object-Oriented” Mean?<a href=\"#what-does-object-oriented-mean\" aria-label=\"what does object oriented mean permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>If you translate “Object-Oriented” literally, you get something like “directed toward objects.” The “objects” here refer to independent entities that exist in the real world. This is usually the very first concept you encounter when learning OOP. It’s actually quite simple once you understand it, but since it’s not something we consciously think about in daily life, it can feel confusing at first.</p>\n<p>To explain objects, we need to introduce the concept of classes as well. The terminology isn’t the most intuitive, but the underlying idea is something anyone can grasp. Most tutorials use the cookie-cutter-and-cookie analogy, but instead of starting with “a class is X, an object is Y,” I’d rather begin with OOP’s broader design concept and let things fall into place naturally.</p>\n<p>Let’s set aside the dry terminology for now and just follow along with an example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"classes-and-objects\" style=\"position:relative;\">Classes and Objects<a href=\"#classes-and-objects\" aria-label=\"classes and objects permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>At the top of this post, I said OOP is about reflecting the real world in program design. Once you understand what that means, concepts like classes and objects will click naturally. So let’s first explore <em>why</em> OOP is called a design approach that mirrors reality.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of examples we could use, but everyday objects tend to resonate best. I’ll use smartphones as my example. Since I use an iPhone 7 made by Apple, let’s start there.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/b4294/iphone7.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"iphone7\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/b4294/iphone7.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/0913d/iphone7.jpg 160w,\n/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/cb69c/iphone7.jpg 320w,\n/static/d1e74fbc89cf5f9b31acf2e22b89f6f9/b4294/iphone7.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>If we wanted to model the iPhone 7 as a program, we’d first need to define what an iPhone 7 actually <em>is</em>.

The concepts like iPhone 7 and iPhone are what we call <strong>classes</strong>.</p>\n<p>And the act of creating these higher-level concepts? That’s called <strong>abstraction</strong>. I’ll explain abstraction in more detail shortly — for now, just remember the concept of classes.</p>\n<p>So what’s an <strong>object</strong>? Notice how many times I used the word “concept” when explaining classes. That’s exactly what a class is — it represents a concept. But a concept alone can’t become a tangible thing in reality.</p>\n<p>Think about it: “iPhone 7” is just the name of a product line. It’s not a specific, unique physical item. By “unique,” I mean unique at the level of “only one exists in the entire world.” My iPhone 7 and your iPhone 7 are actually different iPhone 7s, aren’t they?</p>\n<p>In other words, the iPhone 7 class has no tangible existence on its own. The class defines specs like CPU, display resolution, and memory. A factory uses these specs to produce an <em>actual</em> iPhone 7, assigns it a serial number, and ships it. Only then do we have a physical iPhone 7 we can hold in our hands.</p>\n<p>That produced iPhone 7 has a unique serial number, so we know there’s only one iPhone 7 in the world with serial number <code class=\"language-text\">1234</code>.</p>\n<p>These produced iPhone 7s are what we call <strong>objects</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short, a class is a blueprint, and you need to use it to create an actual, usable thing. An object is the real thing created from a class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This OOP design approach lets us abstract most concepts from our daily lives. It’s actually fun to practice abstracting everything you see around you. A few examples:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Sonata → Midsize Sedan → Sedan → Car → Vehicle</li>\n<li>Evan Moon → Male → Human → Primate → Mammal → Animal</li>\n<li>Overwatch → FPS Game → Game → Software</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Almost every concept in our daily lives can be organized through this kind of abstraction. Practicing this with everyday objects is a great exercise you can do anytime — once you get the hang of it, you can sit in a café drinking coffee and mentally model the entire café as a program.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, “object-oriented” means starting from the ability to represent everything in the real world by defining abstract concepts as classes and creating usable objects from those classes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lets-think-about-abstraction-more-deeply\" style=\"position:relative;\">Let’s Think About Abstraction More Deeply<a href=\"#lets-think-about-abstraction-more-deeply\" aria-label=\"lets think about abstraction more deeply permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>We just walked through a simple abstraction exercise starting from iPhone 7 and working upward. But you probably didn’t have to think very hard, because concepts like iPhone and smartphone are already deeply familiar. They were already somewhat abstracted and organized in your mind.</p>\n<p>In real program design, however, you often need to define the concepts from scratch — they’re not always familiar everyday things. If you don’t precisely understand what abstraction is, you risk designing classes in strange directions. So let’s nail this down.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the word “abstraction” itself. Abstraction means identifying and capturing specific attributes from the many attributes an entity possesses. Looking at how Picasso progressively abstracted a bull in his famous series of lithographs gives a nice visual of what abstraction is:</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 488px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/155ab/picasso_bull.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 94.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"picasso bull\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/155ab/picasso_bull.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/0913d/picasso_bull.jpg 160w,\n/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/cb69c/picasso_bull.jpg 320w,\n/static/6dc8c06c81d4f63100e40d0026453f47/155ab/picasso_bull.jpg 488w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>Picasso's progressive abstraction of a bull</small>\n</center>\n<p>Abstraction is about identifying the most characteristic attributes of something.</p>\n<p>When we derived “iPhone” from “iPhone 7,” the process felt quite intuitive. But if you always approach abstraction that intuitively, it actually becomes harder to stay on track. The proper approach is to look at all the iPhone models and identify their <em>common</em> traits first, then use those to create the parent concept. The attributes of a properly abstracted parent concept will be universally applicable to all its children.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Parent concept</strong><br />\niPhone: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Child concepts based on the iPhone class</strong><br />\niPhone X: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple, with no home button and a bezel-less design.<br />\niPhone 7: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple, with a home button featuring a built-in haptic engine.<br />\niPhone SE: An iOS-based smartphone made by Apple, compact enough to hold comfortably in one hand.<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As this example shows, child concepts inherit all the attributes of the parent concept — which is why this process is called <strong>inheritance</strong>. I’ll cover inheritance in more detail below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-big-three-of-oop\" style=\"position:relative;\">The Big Three of OOP<a href=\"#the-big-three-of-oop\" aria-label=\"the big three of oop permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>The concepts of classes, objects, and abstraction that we just covered are the foundations of OOP. Now I want to go a step further and explain a few more concepts that OOP-supporting languages provide. OOP programs are designed by assembling classes and objects, and these additional concepts exist to make that assembly smoother.</p>\n<p>Some of these concepts aren’t implemented in JavaScript, so I’ll use Java for the examples. The syntax differences are minor enough at a glance that JavaScript developers should have no trouble following along. TypeScript does support OOP as well, but setting it up is more hassle than just compiling Java, so Java it is.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a quick look at the “Big Three” of OOP: inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inheritance\" style=\"position:relative;\">Inheritance<a href=\"#inheritance\" aria-label=\"inheritance permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Inheritance is the concept I briefly touched on when explaining abstraction. In many OOP languages, inheritance is expressed with the <code class=\"language-text\">extends</code> keyword. From the child’s perspective, it’s inheriting the parent’s attributes; from the parent’s perspective, its attributes are being extended into the child — hence <code class=\"language-text\">extends</code>. Let’s see how it works in code.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-java line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> manufacturer <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"apple\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> os <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"iOS\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Main</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">void</span> main <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token class-name\">String</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> args<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span> myIPhone7 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">System</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>out<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">println</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myIPhone7<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>manufacturer<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">System</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>out<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">println</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myIPhone7<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>os<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token class-name\">System</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>out<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">println</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myIPhone7<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>version<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">apple\niOS\n7</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>When creating the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone7</code> class, we used <code class=\"language-text\">extends</code> to inherit from <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code>. Even though <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone7</code> doesn’t explicitly declare <code class=\"language-text\">manufacturer</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">os</code>, it inherits those attributes from its parent class <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we need to create an <code class=\"language-text\">IPhoneX</code> class, we can reuse the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code> class directly:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-java line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhoneX</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>In other words, if you’ve built a well-abstracted class, you can reuse it whenever you need another class with similar attributes. And if a change applies across the entire iPhone series, you only need to modify the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code> class — all child classes inherit the change automatically. This shortens development time and reduces the chance of human error.</p>\n<p>But what if requirements change and you now need to model the Galaxy series? Galaxy phones use Android instead of iOS and are made by Samsung, not Apple — so we can’t reuse the <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone</code> class. We could just create a separate <code class=\"language-text\">Galaxy</code> class, but we could also go one level higher and create a <code class=\"language-text\">SmartPhone</code> class:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-java line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> manufacturer<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> os<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>manufacturer <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> manufacturer<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>os <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> os<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"apple\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"iOS\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Galaxy</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SmartPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">Galaxy</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"samsung\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"android\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone7</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IPhone</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">GalaxyS10</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Galaxy</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> version <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"s10\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">super</code> method calls the parent class’s constructor. Parent classes are also called “super classes” and child classes “sub classes” — hence the <code class=\"language-text\">super</code> keyword.</p>\n<p>Child classes like <code class=\"language-text\">IPhone7</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">GalaxyS10</code> can also override the parent’s <code class=\"language-text\">manufacturer</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">os</code> attributes — this is called <strong>overriding</strong>. If you’ve done Android development, you’ve seen the <code class=\"language-text\">@Override</code> decorator constantly — it’s the same mechanism.</p>\n<p>This class dependency structure improves class reusability, but if inheritance hierarchies become too complex, they become difficult to understand. It’s important to design inheritance with clear intent and reasonable depth. <small>(Though what counts as “reasonable” varies from developer to developer — that’s the catch.)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"encapsulation\" style=\"position:relative;\">Encapsulation<a href=\"#encapsulation\" aria-label=\"encapsulation permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Encapsulation means hiding a class’s internal workings so that users of the class only need to know <em>how</em> to use it, not <em>how it works inside</em>.</p>\n<p>By encapsulating a class, consumers don’t need to puzzle over internal logic.

Polymorphism is the concept that rescues us from exactly this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>Remember: I defined polymorphism as “a single variable or method name being interpreted differently depending on the context.” So if we unify all hero ultimate methods under the name <code class=\"language-text\">ultimate</code> but have each hero execute different code when it’s called — that’s polymorphism.</p>\n<p>We could manually add an <code class=\"language-text\">ultimate</code> method to each hero class that extends <code class=\"language-text\">Hero</code>, but that leaves room for developer error. <small>(Typos being the most common offender.)</small> So Java provides features that <em>force</em> developers to implement certain methods.</p>\n<p>Those features are <strong>abstract classes</strong> and <strong>interfaces</strong>. As I mentioned, I’ll only use abstract classes here.</p>\n<p>For the curious: in brief, abstract classes are for extending an existing class’s functionality, while interfaces define a pure contract with no implementation. Interfaces can’t contain method implementations, but abstract classes can. <small>(Since Java 8, interfaces can have <code class=\"language-text\">default</code> methods with implementations — blurring the distinction further.)</small></p>\n<p>Our <code class=\"language-text\">Hero</code> class receives a <code class=\"language-text\">name</code> from the constructor and stores it — so an abstract class is the better fit.

Don’t confuse this with <em>overriding</em>, which I mentioned briefly in the inheritance section.</p>\n<p>Overriding replaces a parent class’s member variable or method. Overloading lets you use the same method name for different behaviors depending on the arguments — it’s a polymorphism feature. <small>(I used to mix these up on exams all the time.)</small></p>\n<p>Overloading is a straightforward concept, but it can be surprising for developers who primarily use languages like JavaScript or Python that don’t support it. The reason: overloading means “calling a completely different method based on what arguments you pass — even though the method name is identical.”</p>\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/3abde762b5e8eea7abbf6e856bc86e9e/dog_voice.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n  <small>Wait, what?</small>\n</center>\n<p>Imagine a class with a <code class=\"language-text\">sum</code> method that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

This approach turns “a method that adds two arguments” into “a method that adds <em>n</em> arguments,” but it can’t change the fundamental <em>behavior</em> of the method. True polymorphism requires the ability to change the operation itself, not just the argument count.</p>\n<p>Java and C++, on the other hand, support proper overloading:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-java line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Overloading</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> sum <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> b<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> sum <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> b<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> c<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> c<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> sum <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">String</span> b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token string\">\" it is.\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>We’ve declared multiple <code class=\"language-text\">sum</code> methods with the same name.

If you studied computer science — or even took a CS elective — you’ve almost certainly encountered OOP in a university course.</p>\n<p>The audience I’m writing for is people who recently learned to code at a bootcamp or similar program. From what I’ve seen, unless the curriculum is Java-based, bootcamps rarely cover OOP in any meaningful way.</p>\n<p>It’s understandable — bootcamps aim to get students job-ready in a short time, which means prioritizing practical skills. But OOP isn’t a Java-only concept; it’s a universal programming paradigm applicable to any language, so it’s a shame when it gets skipped.</p>\n<p>To be clear: I’m not saying “OOP is great, therefore you must learn it.” As I mentioned at the top, the world’s most popular languages — Java, Python, C++ — are either designed around OOP or fully support it. If you’re writing code today, you need to understand OOP whether you personally love it or not.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/7ca1f/language_index.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 41.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA6ElEQVR42nWS6RKDIAyEff8X9RwVjwJeqV86oYzT/thxIZtlAxbOOZmmSbZtk77vZVmWxGOMQr3rOhmGQcZx1Nq+7+K9l7Isdc0+9eM4pKDpPE8tADZpuK5L+bquukYD4IC+qqrSoYCeIoSgAsw49cOjhPBSA4SkNo0Z0tc0jfJ5nnVK9GpIEsRfHiXehnDEeXIA5/C2bZMmGVJgk+jGLeFxCxDSyPdpWNe1cmpMooYY/U7o08gY2tXkI+cJwf+ENw9+VYG97nNkDC0hdaCPYiZ2qr7knZY7RODcqCOhyUEAfif0docYvgE1GW9g4T9oMQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"language index\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/6af66/language_index.png\" srcset=\"/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/69538/language_index.png 160w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/72799/language_index.png 320w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/6af66/language_index.png 640w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/d9199/language_index.png 960w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/21b4d/language_index.png 1280w,\n/static/404c558b3a2fcd4454b64ed3fc28f4e5/7ca1f/language_index.png 1890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>\n    TIOBE language rankings, August 2019<br>\n    Every language in the top ranks except C, JavaScript, and SQL uses OOP.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>There’s no single right answer among programming paradigms.
