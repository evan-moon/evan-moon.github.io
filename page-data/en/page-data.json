There were constant hallucination problems, and the output quality wasn’t particularly impressive.</p>\n<p>Three years later, a significant chunk of how I spend my day has changed.</p>\n<p>The job used to be something like: understand what people need, design a solution, write code until it exists. You’d take requirements written in natural language, think through the design, and translate all of it into code by hand.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, my morning started with opening an editor and placing the cursor in a blank file. Now it’s more like: explain the context to an AI, read what comes back, ask again, adjust, repeat.</p>\n<p>I’ve been through the shift from feature phones to smartphones - that already felt fast. This is faster.</p>\n<p>AI coding agents have been well past “basic autocomplete” for a while now. Give them a clear prompt and they’ll produce a function or module that’s hard to distinguish from what a developer would write. In this environment, writing every line yourself is becoming inefficient for at least some categories of work.</p>\n<p>Things will probably keep accelerating. How the developer role reshapes itself will depend on the team and the context. The question is what to focus on now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"from-code-writer-to-decision-maker\" style=\"position:relative;\">From code writer to decision-maker<a href=\"#from-code-writer-to-decision-maker\" aria-label=\"from code writer to decision maker permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>To answer that, it helps to look at where the time goes. Time used to go into typing. Now it goes into prompting, reading generated output, adjusting, and prompting again.</p>\n<p>Building software is shifting from direct code authorship toward something more like judgment - not just checking whether the AI did what you asked, but verifying that the business intent actually made it through to the technical implementation.</p>\n<p>You could argue that as AI improves, even code review will be automated away. I don’t think so, and the reason isn’t about technical capability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"someone-has-to-be-accountable-for-the-code\" style=\"position:relative;\">Someone has to be accountable for the code<a href=\"#someone-has-to-be-accountable-for-the-code\" aria-label=\"someone has to be accountable for the code permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>A lot of developers are already using AI for code review - it reads the PR and leaves comments. Honestly, some of those comments are pretty sharp. It catches things I’d miss.</p>\n<p>But I think there’ll always be a human who needs to put the final stamp on “this is okay to ship.” The reason comes down to one question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the code causes a problem, who is responsible?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>AI is not a legal entity. It cannot be held accountable. So when AI-generated code breaks something, the question of who answers for it becomes urgent.</p>\n<p>Say AI-written code has a bug in the payment logic that charges customers the wrong amount.

Put yourself on the receiving end and it’s infuriating.</p>\n<p>No matter who wrote the code, someone is accountable. The way I see it, that’s the developer who reviewed and approved it, and the organization they work for.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just speculation - it’s already showing up in regulation.</p>\n<p>The EU AI Act, which took effect in 2024, mandates human oversight of AI systems in high-risk areas like healthcare, finance, and infrastructure. The principle is clear: even when AI makes the call, humans must be able to review the process. It’s now law.</p>\n<p>There are also ongoing discussions in the EU about extending product liability frameworks to digital products and software. “AI made it, not us” is becoming a harder argument to make legally.</p>\n<p>Real-world precedents outside software point the same direction. When autonomous vehicles crash, liability goes to the manufacturer and driver. FDA-approved AI diagnostic tools still require a physician to make the final call.

It reproduces the patterns that appear most often in training data. Those patterns are, by definition, code that runs. Code that runs and code that’s easy to maintain six months later are two different things.</p>\n<p>Newer models are getting better at factoring in maintainability. But that’s not quite the point. Output quality and predicting the long-term cost of change are separate problems.</p>\n<p>Software quality doesn’t reveal itself immediately. The cost of a bad design shows up when you have to change the code, not when you write it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evaluating-code-from-multiple-angles\" style=\"position:relative;\">Evaluating code from multiple angles<a href=\"#evaluating-code-from-multiple-angles\" aria-label=\"evaluating code from multiple angles permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>This was true before AI too. The difference now is that generation speed has increased, so deferred costs accumulate faster.</p>\n<p>Review covers multiple dimensions. Functional correctness - does it do the right thing - is the part tests can catch. The harder part is structural quality.</p>\n<p>Is this module’s responsibility scoped correctly? Is the dependency direction right? Is this interface flexible enough for future changes? Tests don’t answer these. Then there’s performance: the code works, but does it hold up when data volume is 10x? And security: is input validation sufficient, or is there a missing authorization check somewhere?</p>\n<p>Evaluating code across all of these dimensions at once is a different skill from just reading code.</p>\n<p>And as generation speed increases, this gets harder.</p>\n<p>When developers wrote everything by hand, there was a physical ceiling on output. A developer can only type so much in a day, so the volume of code the team needed to review was naturally paced. Writing slowly doesn’t make code better - but it does mean production couldn’t easily outpace review capacity.</p>\n<p>When AI can generate hundreds of lines in seconds, that balance breaks easily. Without solid review standards, parallel review processes, and automated gates, you can double or triple code volume while review capacity stays flat. Things start slipping through. Technical debt accumulates faster. The production line sped up but the quality control process didn’t.</p>\n<p>My guess is this explains why many companies adopt AI and still don’t feel more productive. Code production got faster; review became the bottleneck.</p>\n<p>In this structure, developers who can review code well and quickly become more valuable. The more code AI generates, the more you need someone who can filter out the hidden risks and bad abstractions mixed into that output.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abstraction\" style=\"position:relative;\">Abstraction<a href=\"#abstraction\" aria-label=\"abstraction permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Abstraction is another one. At its core, abstraction means deciding what to hide and what to expose in a complex system - where to draw the lines.</p>\n<p>AI can do abstraction. It defines interfaces, divides classes, separates modules. Formally speaking, it sometimes does this better than I would. But there’s a key difference between AI abstraction and what an experienced developer produces.</p>\n<p>AI abstraction is based on statistical averages from training data. It takes patterns that looked plausible across thousands of projects and applies whichever one fits closest. But real software design isn’t a multiple-choice test. It’s a series of tradeoff decisions made under resource constraints and uncertainty about the future.</p>\n<p>AI can maintain internal consistency in code. What it struggles with is factoring in external context - the stuff that lives outside the codebase - when deciding where to draw the lines. Code that’s optimal for a specific situation requires strategic judgment that goes beyond statistical norms.</p>\n<p>This isn’t really a flaw in AI - it’s a structural limit of statistical learning. You can produce code that’s good on average. Code that’s optimal for your specific situation is a different problem.</p>\n<p>The dangerous thing about AI-generated code is that it looks fine. Files are properly separated, naming follows convention, patterns are familiar. It passes review easily.</p>\n<p>The problem shows up later. You try to add a payment method and realize the “cleanly separated” structure requires changes in five different places simultaneously. This kind of defect doesn’t appear when you write the code. It appears when you try to change it.</p>\n<p>AI-generated code shows this pattern fairly often. The structure follows common conventions perfectly, but it doesn’t quite fit the actual requirements.</p>\n<p>A frontend example: ask AI to build a dashboard component and it typically produces one giant component with data fetching, state management, and UI rendering all mixed together. Or it over-applies best practices from training data and builds three custom hooks and a context provider just to render a single chart.</p>\n<p>One is under-abstracted, one is over-abstracted. Both are wrong in the same way: neither fits the actual complexity level of the project. Good abstraction means creating exactly as much structure as the current situation requires. Knowing how much that is requires knowing the context.</p>\n<p>An experienced developer reads this code, recognizes that the boundaries were drawn without understanding the domain, and redraws them. What that takes isn’t coding skill. It’s understanding of the system and a sense of design.</p>\n<p>The same standard applies whether a human or AI wrote the code: is this abstraction actually reducing complexity, or just adding more indirection to track? Being able to ask that question is already a skill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"articulating-tacit-knowledge\" style=\"position:relative;\">Articulating tacit knowledge<a href=\"#articulating-tacit-knowledge\" aria-label=\"articulating tacit knowledge permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>If abstraction is knowing where to draw the lines, articulating tacit knowledge is being able to explain why the lines go there. Related, but different. In practice they work together.</p>\n<p>The instinct for recognizing bad code builds up gradually through reading and writing a lot of code. It usually starts as “something feels off” - tacit knowledge that’s genuinely hard to put into words.</p>\n<p>Translating that instinct into language matters more now. “Something feels off” needs to become “this function has two responsibilities” or “this interface will break under change” - concrete enough to actually direct an AI.</p>\n<p>This isn’t about prompt tricks like few-shot examples or chain-of-thought formatting. Those get absorbed into the model as it improves. What I’m talking about is the underlying ability: clearly defining what needs to be built, and knowing which context matters enough to include.</p>\n<p>Anyone can say “build me this thing.” What matters is being able to identify exactly what’s wrong with what comes back, and explain specifically why it should be built differently.</p>\n<p>Seeing “something wrong” code and knowing concretely what that something is - that’s design competence. The deeper your understanding of the system, the more precise your instructions to AI can be.</p>\n<p>You don’t manipulate memory directly anymore, but you still need to understand the memory model to debug performance problems. You may not write every line of code, but you still need to understand abstraction to catch design problems. There’s an extra layer of indirection; the underlying need hasn’t gone away.</p>\n<p>These skills have a longer shelf life than tool fluency. Tool fluency expires when the tool does. jQuery gave way to React. Webpack gave way to Vite. Design judgment and the ability to articulate tacit knowledge are valid as long as software has essential complexity - which is to say, indefinitely.</p>\n<p>That complexity doesn’t disappear when the tools change. Payment systems are complicated because payments are complicated, not because of the framework. The instinct for handling that complexity doesn’t belong to any particular tool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-deliberate-practice\" style=\"position:relative;\">The need for deliberate practice<a href=\"#the-need-for-deliberate-practice\" aria-label=\"the need for deliberate practice permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>A reasonable question at this point: if you’re writing less code, how do you build abstraction sense and design instinct?</p>\n<p>There’s a real tension here.

That complexity comes from the nature of the problem, not the limits of the tools.</p>\n<p>So even though AI is different from previous tools, as long as humans remain the accountable parties, the skills required for that judgment don’t change. If anything, automating production makes the judgment in quality control more visible, not less.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 567px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/cfed549021f0c0b30f757fa171543e0e/a7172/buffett.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgADBf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAeYyjCUf/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhEBAwAQEjL/2gAIAQEAAQUC5WGtCcs7FNnv/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAGBAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABARITH/2gAIAQEABj8CtwYv/8QAGhABAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIUExYf/aAAgBAQABPyE467sWTrE+ysYV5LIIWp//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEKQP/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPxA//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPxA//8QAHRABAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIUExUaGx8P/aAAgBAQABPxDEcgNGGLqrkx1qJeFUEoYj7cYsU4WvVRSnYPif/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"buffett\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/cfed549021f0c0b30f757fa171543e0e/a7172/buffett.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/cfed549021f0c0b30f757fa171543e0e/0913d/buffett.jpg 160w,\n/static/cfed549021f0c0b30f757fa171543e0e/cb69c/buffett.jpg 320w,\n/static/cfed549021f0c0b30f757fa171543e0e/a7172/buffett.jpg 567w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <small>A coach I work with compared this situation to Buffett's line:<br>\n  \"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\"<br>\n  I can't think of a better analogy.\n  </small>\n</center>\n<p>This is why it feels slightly off when I see so many developers focused on getting better at using AI.</p>\n<p>A year ago, prompt engineering was the big topic.

But if the internal structure — like the order of a list or the height of a tree — were altered in the process, that’s no longer mapping; it’s “reconstruction.” The identity law is what lets you trust that a functor only touches the contents, never the wrapper.</p>\n<p>And if the composition law holds, we’re guaranteed that <code class=\"language-text\">a.map(f).map(g)</code> produces the same result as <code class=\"language-text\">a.map(x => g(f(x)))</code>.</p>\n<p>This guarantees that <code class=\"language-text\">a.map(f).map(g)</code>, which loops twice, can be collapsed into <code class=\"language-text\">a.map(x => g(f(x)))</code> with a single loop and produce the same behavior. Conversely, it also means it’s safe to split complex logic into multiple <code class=\"language-text\">map</code> calls for readability.</p>\n<p>But even functors have their limits.

Must satisfy associativity.</li>\n<li>An identity element: a special element that, when combined with any other element, returns that element unchanged.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>The concept is abstract enough to feel intimidating, but the examples aren’t that complicated. The most classic monoid is the relationship between integers and addition.</p>\n<p>With integers and addition, the addition operation takes two elements from the set of integers and returns another integer. Just like <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">1 + 2 = 3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7278em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">+</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">3</span></span></span></span></span>. And as you already know, addition satisfies the associativity law.

But in practice, what matters more than just implementing the code is understanding the context these tools carry and recognizing how they differ from existing tools.</p>\n<p>Many monad tutorials, including my own earlier ones, have explained functors and monads using the “box” metaphor. While intuitive, this metaphor only tells half the story.</p>\n<p>If you think of <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> as merely “a box containing a future value,” it’s hard to explain why <code class=\"language-text\">then</code> must execute sequentially. So rather than calling functors and monads simple boxes, it’s more accurate to describe them as “the context of a computation accompanied by a particular effect.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, what <code class=\"language-text\">flatMap</code> does isn’t simply “open the box and flatten it” — it’s closer to “safely chaining computations with different contexts.”</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Monad</th>\n<th>Context (Effect)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">Maybe</code></td>\n<td>The context of a value that might not exist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">Result</code></td>\n<td>The context that includes the reason for failure (error)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code></td>\n<td>The context of an asynchronous computation that takes time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">Array</code></td>\n<td>A nondeterministic context where multiple results may exist</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>One more thing worth noting: we need to reconsider <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code>. In code, <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> behaves in a very monadic way, but under strict mathematical scrutiny, it’s not a monad.</p>\n<p>A monad requires <code class=\"language-text\">map</code> (which preserves structure) and <code class=\"language-text\">flatMap</code> (which flattens structure) to be strictly separated, but Promise’s <code class=\"language-text\">then</code> mixes them depending on the return value.</p>\n<p>On top of that, a mathematical monad must allow a doubly-nested state <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">⟨</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">⟨</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">⟩</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">T\\langle T\\langle A \\rangle \\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mopen\">⟨</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mopen\">⟨</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mclose\">⟩⟩</span></span></span></span></span> to exist, but Promise doesn’t allow this at runtime — it collapses immediately into a single layer.

Reading code is a fairly expensive operation for the brain.</p>\n<p>So far, this might seem unsurprising. But the more interesting part is the difference between experts and novices. Skilled developers showed lower overall brain activation levels when reading code. Not because they were trying less, but because they were processing more efficiently. Novice developers showed widespread brain activation, meaning they were consciously processing nearly everything one piece at a time.</p>\n<p>Novices tended to read code like natural language text, top to bottom.

Miller published <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/h0043158\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two”</a>, showing that human short-term memory capacity is roughly 7±2 items. Later research revised this downward. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x01003922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cowan (2001)</a> found the number of chunks you can hold in working memory at once is closer to 3–4. It varies by task and expertise, but either way, it’s smaller than you’d think.</p>\n<p>Think about what we load into our heads when reading code. The current value of a variable, the direction of control flow, the order of function calls, the state of the current scope… all of these occupy working memory slots. When those slots fill up, the brain struggles to take in new information. That’s the moment you get that “this code feels complicated” sensation.</p>\n<p>To put it in programming terms, working memory is like a fixed-size stack.</p>\n<p>Real working memory is a far more complex system than a stack, but the analogy works well enough: there’s a capacity limit, and exceeding it causes things to break down. The stack size is roughly 4, and exceeding it causes a stack overflow. In practice, the items occupying each slot aren’t uniform in size, and interference between items also occurs, so the exact number matters less than the fact that capacity is limited. The moment that capacity hits its limit is when you feel “this code is hard to read.”</p>\n<p>Let’s compare code that rapidly exhausts working memory with code that doesn’t.</p>\n<div

this version, the amount you need to hold in your head at each step is noticeably reduced. The behavior is identical, but by breaking information into consistent units, how much context occupies each working memory slot becomes manageable.</p>\n<p>When reading <code class=\"language-text\">calculateDiscount</code>, you only need to focus on discount logic. When reading <code class=\"language-text\">processOrder</code>, you can follow the overall flow without knowing each calculation’s internals. Each function fits within working memory’s capacity, which is why it feels easier to understand. This is also why abstraction at the right granularity matters in design. Of course, the reverse is true too. Splitting things too finely means you spend working memory jumping between functions and tracking context. The goal isn’t splitting for its own sake, but reducing how much you need to hold in your head at once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chunking-the-brains-data-compression-algorithm\" style=\"position:relative;\">Chunking: The Brain’s Data Compression Algorithm<a href=\"#chunking-the-brains-data-compression-algorithm\" aria-label=\"chunking the brains data compression algorithm permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>But if working memory only has about 4 slots, how do we comprehend hundreds of lines of code?</p>\n<p>The answer is chunking: grouping multiple small units of information into a single meaningful cluster. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5334/joc.451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research from the University of Zurich</a> found that chunking reduces working memory load by swapping individual elements for compressed representations pulled from long-term memory. The freed-up capacity then goes to processing new incoming information.</p>\n<p>Think about phone numbers. Trying to remember <code class=\"language-text\">01012345678</code> as eleven individual digits would far exceed working memory capacity. But split it as <code class=\"language-text\">010-1234-5678</code>, and you only need to remember three chunks. Better yet, if <code class=\"language-text\">010</code> is already familiar as “Korean mobile prefix,” it’s automatically processed as a single chunk, meaning you really only need to memorize two new chunks.</p>\n<p>The same thing happens with code. Look at what happens when a skilled developer reads this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-typescript line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> activeUsers <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> users<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">filter</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>u <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> u<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>isActive<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>u <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> u<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>name<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>A novice developer has to load each individual element into working memory: the <code class=\"language-text\">users</code> variable, how <code class=\"language-text\">.filter</code> works, arrow function syntax, the <code class=\"language-text\">u.isActive</code> property access, how <code class=\"language-text\">.map</code> works, another arrow function…</p>\n<p>For a skilled developer, <code class=\"language-text\">users.filter(...).map(...)</code> is recognized as a single chunk: “filter array then transform.” Having seen this pattern hundreds or thousands of times, they pull a stored chunk from long-term memory and use just one working memory slot. The remaining slots can be allocated to higher-level thinking like “why is this being filtered?” or “where does the result get used?”</p>\n<p>This is the same principle that allows chess masters to glance at a board and grasp the entire situation. Chess masters don’t memorize individual piece positions one by one. They recognize familiar formation patterns as single chunks. That’s why they can quickly recall meaningfully arranged boards but perform no better than novices with randomly placed pieces.</p>\n<p>Code works the same way. Idiomatic code is easy to read not because it’s “correct,” but because it matches chunks already stored in the developer’s long-term memory.</p>\n<p>What makes a pattern idiomatic is shaped by external factors: the language’s design intent, standard library conventions, the community’s repeated choices. It’s not simply “familiar because it’s used a lot.” Convergence driven by multiple forces created that familiarity. This is also why project-specific unique patterns or overly creative code are hard to read. When existing chunks don’t match, the brain has to decompose everything into individual elements, and working memory saturates almost instantly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"system-1-and-system-2-intuition-and-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\">System 1 and System 2: Intuition and Analysis<a href=\"#system-1-and-system-2-intuition-and-analysis\" aria-label=\"system 1 and system 2 intuition and analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This is where Daniel Kahneman’s dual process theory comes in. Kahneman divided human thinking into two systems:</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>System 1</strong>: Fast, automatic, intuitive thinking. Based on pattern recognition.</li>\n<li><strong>System 2</strong>: Slow, conscious, analytical thinking. Based on logical reasoning.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Most of our everyday judgments are handled by System 1. Driving a car, sensing your partner’s mood from a single word over the phone. When encountering new information, System 1 doesn’t create new patterns; it matches against patterns already stored.</p>\n<p>When System 1 gets stuck, that’s when System 2 gets called in. The moment you consciously think “what is this?” and start analyzing, that’s System 2 engaging. Apply this framework to code reading, and a lot starts to make sense.</p>\n<p>Readable code is code that’s mostly processed by System 1’s pattern recognition, with minimal System 2 involvement.</p>\n<p>When skilled developers read code, familiar patterns are handled automatically by System 1. <code class=\"language-text\">for</code> loops, <code class=\"language-text\">if-else</code> branches, <code class=\"language-text\">map</code>/<code class=\"language-text\">filter</code>/<code class=\"language-text\">reduce</code> chaining, <code class=\"language-text\">try-catch</code> blocks. These have been seen thousands of times, so they’re processed without conscious effort. System 2 stays in a comfortable low-power mode, just approving the information that System 1 surfaces.</p>\n<p>But when an unexpected pattern appears, things change.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-typescript line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Code that System 1 can handle</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> canPurchase <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> user<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>age <span class=\"token operator\">>=</span> <span class=\"token number\">18</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> user<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>isVerified<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Code that invokes System 2</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> canPurchase <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token operator\">!</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>user<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>age <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">18</span> <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> <span class=\"token operator\">!</span>user<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>isVerified<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>user<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>age <span class=\"token operator\">!==</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">undefined</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Both express the same intent. But the moment you see the second version, System 1 sends an “I don’t know” signal, and System 2 begins its expensive analysis. You have to unwind the double negation, run De Morgan’s law in your head, and figure out why that final <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code> check is necessary. This transition itself is a cognitive cost.</p>\n<p>Kahneman called this cognitive strain. The more System 2 has to step in, the more energy the brain burns and the more fatigued you feel. The “this code is hard to read” sensation is the cognitive cost of System 1 failing to match a pattern and handing things off to System 2.</p>\n<p>From this angle, feedback like “this is hard to understand” in code reviews isn’t just taste.

Algorithm difficulty, domain complexity, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Extraneous load</strong>: Unnecessary complexity from presentation that’s irrelevant to the task. Inconsistent naming, unnecessary indirection, confusing code structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Germane load</strong>: The beneficial load spent forming and learning new schemas.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>The takeaway for writing readable code: minimize extraneous load.</p>\n<p>Intrinsic load can’t be reduced. It’s inherent to the problem. Code implementing a distributed consensus algorithm will be complex no matter how well it’s written. The problem is when extraneous load from “how it’s expressed” piles unnecessarily on top of intrinsic load.</p>\n<p>From this perspective, consistent naming, appropriate function decomposition, clear type declarations, meaningful blank lines: these all reduce extraneous cognitive load. They keep the brain’s limited resources from being wasted on presentation issues so you can focus on the actual problem.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2023.111619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023 systematic literature review</a> found something interesting here. Among studies comparing source code metrics to measured cognitive load, few traditional metrics showed consistent correlation with what developers actually experienced. Results varied depending on task conditions and measurement methods. What we “measure” as complexity and what a developer’s brain “feels” as complex can be quite different.</p>\n<p>Mechanical metrics capture surface-level complexity, but the cognitive load you actually experience depends on how familiar the patterns are, how efficiently your brain chunks them, how clearly the visual structure maps to the logic. These are subjective factors that no metric fully captures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experience-physically-changes-the-brain\" style=\"position:relative;\">Experience Physically Changes the Brain<a href=\"#experience-physically-changes-the-brain\" aria-label=\"experience physically changes the brain permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I mentioned earlier that expert and novice brain activation patterns differ. This isn’t just “more experience = better.” A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56090-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2024 study in Scientific Reports</a> measured brainwaves from 62 Python programmers while showing them code with intentionally inserted syntax errors and semantic errors.</p>\n<p>Skilled programmers showed distinct brainwave patterns for syntax violations versus semantic violations, the same way our brains produce different responses to grammatical errors versus meaning errors in natural language. Programming experience forms specialized neural circuits for processing specific languages and patterns.</p>\n<p>Coding experience physically changes the brain. Through neuroplasticity, patterns you encounter repeatedly get stored as schemas in long-term memory, and these schemas become the foundation for chunking. System 1 can automatically process code because these schemas have accumulated over time.</p>\n<p>Because schemas form based on the patterns an individual has been exposed to, people who repeatedly encounter the same patterns in the same codebase end up sharing similar schemas. Flip this around, and maintaining a consistent code style within a team isn’t about taste. It’s the process of forming shared chunks in team members’ brains. Coding conventions matter not for uniformity’s sake, but for collective cognitive efficiency.</p>\n<h2 id=\"predictive-coding-the-brain-doesnt-read-code-it-predicts\" style=\"position:relative;\">Predictive Coding: The Brain Doesn’t Read Code, It Predicts<a href=\"#predictive-coding-the-brain-doesnt-read-code-it-predicts\" aria-label=\"predictive coding the brain doesnt read code it predicts permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Predictive coding theory offers another angle.

None of these mean “correct code.”</p>\n<p>Readability and correctness are separate axes. Code can be perfectly correct but impossible to read, and code can be easy to read but wrong. That said, readable code does make bugs easier to find. With lower extraneous load, the brain can focus its resources on finding logical errors.</p>\n<p>There’s one caveat, though. Kahneman also warned about System 1’s biases. System 1 is fast, but that speed comes at the cost of bias. A classic example is familiarity bias. It’s true that you feel patterns familiar to you as “readable code,” but whether that’s objectively optimal is a separate question. A developer fluent in functional programming might find <code class=\"language-text\">for</code> loops “hard to read,” and vice versa. In those cases, the feeling of “hard to read” may not reflect the code’s objective quality but the bias of chunks stored in your own System 1.</p>\n<p>When giving “this is hard to understand” feedback in code reviews, it’s worth asking yourself once: is this genuinely high-cognitive-load code, or is it simply a pattern not registered in my System 1? If the former, refactoring is needed. If the latter, it might actually be an opportunity to expand your chunk library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>“Readable code” isn’t just a matter of feeling or taste.

To answer this, we need to talk about the Curry-Howard correspondence, the concept that unifies them.</p>\n<p>The Curry-Howard correspondence (also called the Curry-Howard isomorphism) is a direct relationship between computer programs and logical proofs: proof rules in logic correspond to type rules in type systems.</p>\n<p>Logician Haskell Curry first noticed this pattern in the 1930s while adding types to lambda calculus. In 1969, William Howard dug deeper and established these correspondences:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>In Logic</th>\n<th>In Programming</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Proposition</td>\n<td>Type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proof</td>\n<td>Program</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>If A then B</td>\n<td>Function from A to B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A and B</td>\n<td>Tuple/object containing both A and B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A or B</td>\n<td>Union type: A or B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>False (unprovable)</td>\n<td>never (no value can exist)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If I had to boil it down to one line:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Types correspond to propositions, and programs that produce values of those types correspond to proofs of those propositions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>TypeScript is a language that partially borrows this idea for practical purposes. “Partially” because escape hatches like <code class=\"language-text\">any</code> and type assertions exist.</p>\n<p>So in this post, when I say “proof,” think of it as “fulfilling the contract that the type rules demand.” I’ll revisit TypeScript’s limitations at the end.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logical-structures-through-types\" style=\"position:relative;\">Logical Structures Through Types<a href=\"#logical-structures-through-types\" aria-label=\"logical structures through types permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Let’s now look at how the Curry-Howard correspondence actually manifests, one piece at a time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"functions-evidence-of-if-a-then-b\" style=\"position:relative;\">Functions: Evidence of “If A Then B”<a href=\"#functions-evidence-of-if-a-then-b\" aria-label=\"functions evidence of if a then b permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>Let’s start with the most fundamental correspondence: function types.

Why?</p>\n<p>In logic, there’s an equivalence called the Exportation law, and currying is a pattern based on this concept:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"math math-inline\"><span

I’ll cover two representative ones here.</p>\n<p>The first escape hatch is the existence of <code class=\"language-text\">any</code> and type assertions. <code class=\"language-text\">any</code> is a declaration to skip type checking entirely. In logical terms, it’s like “accepting anything as true without verification.” Type assertions via <code class=\"language-text\">as</code> are the same.</p>\n<p>These are escape hatches that bypass the proof system, which is why TypeScript becomes a language that permits logical contradictions.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-typescript line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> x<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">any</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"hello\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> y<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">number</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> x<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Assigning a string to a number type</span>\n\n<span class=\"token class-name\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span></span> z <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"hello\"</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">unknown</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">number</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>  <span class=\"token comment\">// Forced type conversion</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The second escape hatch is corner cases in structural typing. Notably, function parameter bivariance, index signatures, and optional properties can all undermine logical interpretation.</p>\n<p>Logically, function parameters should be contravariant. In simple terms, if <code class=\"language-text\">Dog</code> is a subtype of <code class=\"language-text\">Animal</code>, then <code class=\"language-text\">(animal: Animal) => void</code> should be a subtype of <code class=\"language-text\">(dog: Dog) => void</code> — because a function that accepts a broader type can substitute for one that accepts a narrower type.</p>\n<p>But TypeScript treats method-syntax function declarations as bivariant:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-typescript line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-typescript\">  <span class=\"token keyword\">interface</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Animal</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">interface</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Dog</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Animal</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> breed<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Handler</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token function\">handle</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>animal<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Animal<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">void</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> dogHandler<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Handler <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// A function that only handles Dogs is assigned where Animal is expected</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// Not caught even with strictFunctionTypes</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">handle</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>dog<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Dog<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">console</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>dog<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>breed<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  dogHandler<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">handle</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"cat\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Possible runtime error</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Index signatures can also lead to logical contradictions.

In a type like <code class=\"language-text\">{ a?: string }</code>, the state where <code class=\"language-text\">a</code> is <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code> and the state where <code class=\"language-text\">a</code> doesn’t exist at all aren’t logically distinguished:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-typescript line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Config</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> timeout<span class=\"token operator\">?</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">number</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> config1<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Config <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> timeout<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">undefined</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// OK</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> config2<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Config <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// OK</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Both are treated as the same type, but</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Object.hasOwn(config1, 'timeout') and Object.hasOwn(config2, 'timeout') differ</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Since TypeScript 4.4, the <code class=\"language-text\">exactOptionalPropertyTypes</code> option lets you more strictly distinguish between “doesn’t exist” and “exists as <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code>.”</p>\n<p>These escape hatches are the result of TypeScript choosing practical JavaScript compatibility over 100% logical soundness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\" style=\"position:relative;\">Wrapping Up<a href=\"#wrapping-up\" aria-label=\"wrapping up permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>This post isn’t about how to use TypeScript better.

That’s why at my previous company, I remember pouring the most energy into hiring.</p>\n<p>But the Toss frontend chapter is a large organization — around 250 people across the broader community, with nearly 140 in the Toss Core frontend chapter where I work. Leading an organization this large requires a different approach than leading a small one.</p>\n<p>At this scale, simply gathering excellent individuals isn’t enough.

It requires a lot of energy at first, but once it starts spinning, momentum allows it to generate bigger results with less effort.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in organizational management, when individual activities connect into a virtuous cycle, excellence naturally accelerates.</p>\n<p>The flywheel I’ve designed for an excellent organization consists of six stages:</p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Recruit</strong>: Gather exceptional talent obsessed with growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: Understand the organization’s expectations and your current state.</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity</strong>: Give prepared talent chances to experience growth in small increments.</li>\n<li><strong>Recognition</strong>: Deliver tangible and psychological rewards to those who’ve grown.</li>\n<li><strong>Contribution</strong>: People with positive experiences participate in chapter activities, making the organization more excellent.</li>\n<li><strong>Branding</strong>: Organize and share the chapter’s work externally.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"stage-1-recruit--gather-exceptional-talent-obsessed-with-growth\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 1: Recruit — Gather Exceptional Talent Obsessed with Growth<a href=\"#stage-1-recruit--gather-exceptional-talent-obsessed-with-growth\" aria-label=\"stage 1 recruit  gather exceptional talent obsessed with growth permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Building an excellent organization requires a continuous inflow of exceptional talent. The important thing here isn’t simply finding skilled people, but people who are obsessed with growth and have high growth potential.</p>\n<p>Identifying these people during the hiring process matters, but what matters even more is branding that makes people on the outside think, “If I go there, I can grow even more” — naturally driving more applications to Toss.</p>\n<p>We need to concretely show what technical capabilities the Toss frontend chapter has and what kind of culture it fosters. This is exactly where Stage 6 (Branding) connects back to Stage 1 (Recruit).</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-2-self-awareness--view-organizational-expectations-and-personal-strengths-through-a-shared-language\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 2: Self-awareness — View Organizational Expectations and Personal Strengths Through a Shared Language<a href=\"#stage-2-self-awareness--view-organizational-expectations-and-personal-strengths-through-a-shared-language\" aria-label=\"stage 2 self awareness  view organizational expectations and personal strengths through a shared language permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I believe growth always starts with self-awareness. So the growth that an excellent organization produces ultimately begins with how accurately each member recognizes their own capabilities and strengths.</p>\n<p>It’s similar to a strategy game. Think of Lü Bu and Zhuge Liang from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Both are exceptional talents, but the moment they’re given mismatched roles, their excellence vanishes. Assigning Lü Bu to domestic administration or sending Zhuge Liang into single combat would obviously produce poor results.</p>\n<p>The problem is that in reality, people often don’t know whether they’re a Lü Bu or a Zhuge Liang — or they might be a Lü Bu who says they want to do administration. I think this is less about willpower and more about a lack of self-awareness.</p>\n<p>That’s why I believe the first step toward growth in an excellent organization is helping members accurately recognize their own capabilities and strengths, then connecting them with the right growth opportunities.</p>\n<p>Along these lines, the Toss frontend chapter uses a tool called the Skill Tree. Rather than a device for defining excellence, it’s more like a reference line that helps members see their current capabilities and strengths more clearly, and articulate their next growth direction for themselves.</p>\n<p>Once someone can articulate their growth direction and strengths, leads use this information to coach them so their strengths translate into real outcomes and growth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-3-opportunity--let-people-experience-growth-in-small-increments\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 3: Opportunity — Let People Experience Growth in Small Increments<a href=\"#stage-3-opportunity--let-people-experience-growth-in-small-increments\" aria-label=\"stage 3 opportunity  let people experience growth in small increments permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Once self-awareness is established, what the organization needs to do next is clear: provide opportunities for members to take on challenges without pressure and experience small wins. No matter how well someone understands their strengths and current state, growth remains theoretical without a real arena to try things in.</p>\n<p>This conviction became sharper through a recent leadership survey. The results showed that interest in leadership roles was far greater than expected. However, a common response was: “I’m interested, but I don’t feel ready yet.”</p>\n<p>At first, I assumed members felt their capabilities were lacking. But looking at individual responses more closely, it was closer to “I don’t know what I should be preparing for or what capabilities I need to build.” The chapter wasn’t providing enough hints about the direction and methods of growth.</p>\n<p>So I decided we needed to create more of these opportunities and expose them more frequently. Growth isn’t built from a single giant leap — it’s built on many small wins. We need to create an environment where chapter members can take on challenges without hesitation.</p>\n<p>This problem awareness led to the creation of the Next F-Lead program. This program focuses on three core competencies: strategic thinking, interview skills, and 1-on-1 coaching. The goal isn’t to suddenly turn someone into a lead — it’s to let them experience the F-Lead role in small doses beforehand. Through this, members come to see leadership not as “something far removed from me” but as “a next step I can gradually prepare for.”</p>\n<p>Beyond Next F-Lead, we’re working to help members envision their next steps more clearly through various education and experience programs. The key isn’t pushing anyone in a specific direction — it’s creating an environment where each person can try things and choose for themselves.</p>\n<p>Someone who has experienced small wins can imagine bigger challenges, and that imagination translates into real action toward the next stage of growth. That’s why the Opportunity stage is so important in the flywheel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-4-recognition--let-people-experience-achievement-through-tangible-and-psychological-rewards\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 4: Recognition — Let People Experience Achievement Through Tangible and Psychological Rewards<a href=\"#stage-4-recognition--let-people-experience-achievement-through-tangible-and-psychological-rewards\" aria-label=\"stage 4 recognition  let people experience achievement through tangible and psychological rewards permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Growth isn’t completed by experience alone. Recognition must follow for those who’ve produced growth. Positive feedback as a reward is easily underestimated in organizational management, but it’s one of the most important elements for re-accelerating the flywheel.</p>\n<p>Within the Toss frontend chapter, there are already many people contributing to the organization by showing their strengths — people who consistently share technical knowledge, participate in activities like the Open Source Committee or Code Quality Committee, or build and share tools that help colleagues work better.</p>\n<p>These contributions elevate the organization, but if their value isn’t made visible enough, even the contributors themselves may struggle to feel their own achievements. That’s why I believe these people need to be recognized more often and more clearly.</p>\n<p>The same goes for people in lead roles. They don’t just deliver their own results — they help colleagues grow right beside them. From the organization’s perspective, it’s an extremely important role. From the individual’s perspective, it’s no light responsibility. There’s a lot to do and a lot to think about. For me, every day working alongside these people is filled with gratitude, and their dedication absolutely deserves to be rewarded.</p>\n<p>That’s why the Toss frontend chapter is preparing a dedicated leadership education program for leads. Beyond just training, we’re also planning opportunities for deeper participation in chapter decision-making, along with explicit expansion of authority and roles. This isn’t just a reward — it’s a clear message: “The organization takes your growth seriously.”</p>\n<p>Recognition isn’t the end of achievement. It’s the signal that starts the next phase of growth. Someone who has experienced accomplishment naturally wants to contribute again, and that contribution makes the organization more excellent once more. That’s why the Recognition stage can’t be left out of the flywheel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-5-contribution--positive-experiences-make-the-organization-excellent\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 5: Contribution — Positive Experiences Make the Organization Excellent<a href=\"#stage-5-contribution--positive-experiences-make-the-organization-excellent\" aria-label=\"stage 5 contribution  positive experiences make the organization excellent permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>People who’ve been recognized and experienced achievement naturally start contributing to the organization. And when these contributions are met with the recognition mentioned in Stage 4 — shout-outs, expanded authority, participation in decision-making — the behavior is naturally reinforced. This is the core of the flywheel.</p>\n<p>I believe an organization becomes excellent when knowledge sharing and vigorous debate appear frequently. These are what contribution looks like, and these contributions collectively make an organization excellent.</p>\n<p>The Toss frontend chapter has a long history of such contributions.</p>\n<p>In the early days when the team was small, efforts like building internal libraries, developing TDS (Toss Design System), and creating admin tools were all driven by this kind of contribution. Now it takes the form of technical tool and knowledge sharing, the Open Source Committee, the Code Quality Committee, Frontend Accelerator mentoring, user accessibility improvements, and more.</p>\n<p>Leads who completed Next F-Lead improve the program. Developers active in the Open Source Committee propose new libraries. Chapter members who’ve used the Skill Tree provide feedback. All of this is contribution.</p>\n<p>Systems are improved by individuals, and improved systems in turn make more individuals excellent. The small flywheel is already spinning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-6-branding--share-excellence-with-the-outside-world\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stage 6: Branding — Share Excellence with the Outside World<a href=\"#stage-6-branding--share-excellence-with-the-outside-world\" aria-label=\"stage 6 branding  share excellence with the outside world permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>The final stage is branding — organizing the excellent chapter’s activities and sharing them externally.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Toss frontend chapter is building its brand of excellence through various activities: the Open Source Committee, Frontend Accelerator mentoring, the Frontend Fundamentals documentation project, and the Bonfire YouTube content series, among others.</p>\n<p>For example, the Open Source Committee has produced several libraries including es-toolkit, es-hangul, and overlay-kit. <a href=\"https://es-toolkit.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">es-toolkit</a> in particular has been adopted by big tech companies like Microsoft, as well as well-known tools like Storybook and Yarn.
